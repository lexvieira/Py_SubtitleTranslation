to mess it up,

Yeah.

I've got to go.

Mm-hmm.

00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,491
Great. Thanks.

Donna, we're gonna need
to streamline this.

give me a wink
if they say something clever.

Cool?
Okay.

what makes you think

that I'm gonna let
the whitest man

347
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:26,269
that I have ever seen
interview for our firm?

Because I have
an appointment.

like you're 11 years old.

Of course, sir.

But he didn't go
in the room.

366

to ditch the cops, okay?

Nice to meet you.

No.

386

How the hell did you know
they were the police?

387
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,787
I read this novel
in elementary school,

388
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:00,189
and it was
the exact same thing.

389
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:02,891
You read a novel
in elementary school.

390
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,160
What?
I like to read.

391
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,595
And why'd you ask them
what time it was?

392
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:08,963
Throw 'em off.

393
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:10,331
What kind of drug dealer

what time it is

395
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,801
when he's got a briefcase
full of pot, right?

396

We should hire you.

399

I'll take it.

400
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,410
Unfortunately,

401
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:24,045
we only hire
from Harvard.

402
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:27,382
And you not only did not go
to Harvard Law School,

403
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:29,584
you haven't even gone
to any law school.

404

What if I told you
that I consume knowledge

405
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,322
like no one you've ever met,

406
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,257
and I've actually passed
the bar?

407
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:38,661
I'd say
you're full of crap.

408
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:41,364
That's a Barbri legal handbook
right there, right?

409

Anything.

411
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,408
"Civil liability associated
with agency is based

412
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:54,843
on several factors--"
- "including the deviation

413
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,411
"of the agent
from his path,

414
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:58,379
"the reasonable inference
of agency on behalf

415
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,513
"of the plaintiff,
and the nature

416
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:02,316
of the damages themselves."

417
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:04,385
How did you know that?

418
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,257
I learned it when I studied
for the bar.

419
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:12,161
Okay, hotshot,

420
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:14,097
fire up this laptop.

421
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:16,833
I'm gonna show you

422
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:19,336
what a Harvard attorney
can do.

423
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:22,539
Pick a topic.

424
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,208
Stock option backdating.

425
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:26,176
Although backdating options
is legal,

426
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:28,912
violations arise
related to disclosures

427
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,048
under IRC Section 409a.

428
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:34,217
You forgot
about Sarbanes-Oxley.

429
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,752
The statute of limitations

430
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,354
renders Sarbanes-Oxley moot
post 2007.

431
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:40,223
Not if you can find actions

432
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,991
to cover up the violation

433
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,662
as established in
the Sixth Circuit, May 2008.

434
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,732
That's impressive, but you're
sitting at a computer.

435
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,834
Playing hearts.

436
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:54,604
Sorry.
If you want to beat me,

437
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,339
you're gonna have to do it
at something else.

438
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,207
How can you know
all that?

439
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:59,742
I told you.
I like to read.

440
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,612
And once I read something,
I understand it.

441
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,815
And once I understand it,
I never forget it.

442
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:07,450
Why take the bar?

443
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,254
This dickhead bet me
I couldn't pass it

444
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:12,455
without going to law school.

445
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:17,127
Okay, look,

446
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,329
this is
all pretty fascinating stuff,

447
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:21,498
but I'm afraid
I got to get back to work.

448
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:24,100
I'll make sure
that Serpico isn't around

449
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:26,102
waiting for you.

450
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,484
You want this job so much,

451
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,385
why didn't you just go
to law school?

452
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:45,787
When I was in college,

453
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:47,355
it was my dream
to be a lawyer.

454
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:49,824
I needed some money,

455
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,025
and Trevor convinced me

456
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,094
to memorize this math test

457
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:57,163
and to sell it.

458
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,332
Turns out we sold it
to the Dean's daughter.

459
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,835
I lost my scholarship,
I got kicked out of school,

460
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:06,573
I...

461
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:10,044
I got knocked
into a different life.

462
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:13,413
And I have been wishing
for a way back ever since.

463
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,987
Let me tell you something.

464
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:21,690
This isn't elementary school.
This is hard work.

465
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,692
Long hours.
High pressure.

466
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,862
I need a grown goddamn man.

467
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,931
You give me this,

468
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:29,933
and I will work
as hard as it takes

469
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,635
to school those Harvard douches

470
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:33,470
and become the best lawyer
you have ever seen.

471
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:35,907
I'm inclined
to give you a shot,

472
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:37,442
but what if I decide
to go another way?

473
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,778
I'd say that's fair.

474
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,212
Sometimes I like to hang out
with people

475
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,981
who aren't that bright,
you know,

476
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:44,148
just to see
how the other half lives.

477
00:22:44,216 --> 00:22:46,450
Move over.

478
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:49,319
I'm emailing the firm
I just found our next associate.

479
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:56,559
All right.
You're gonna start a week

480
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:57,760
from Monday.

481
00:22:57,828 --> 00:22:59,161
Here's what you're gonna do.

482
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:01,063
First, no more pot.
We drug test.

483
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,598
Stop smoking now,
you'll be fine,

484
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,133
I assume that's all the drugs
you do.

485
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,902
- How do you know that?
- You read books, I read people.

486
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,205
And potheads smoke pot.
That's what they do.

487
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:10,074
It's not all I do.
I have interests.

488
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:11,542
You're Albert
friggin' Einstein,

489
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,211
and you couldn't manage
to get into law school?

490
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,546
You think that's not
from smoking weed?

491
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:15,914
- Trevor got--
- That's another thing.

492
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:17,816
You're never gonna talk
to Trevor again.

493
00:23:17,884 --> 00:23:19,418
You're gonna ditch
that briefcase,

494
00:23:19,486 --> 00:23:21,252
and you're gonna get on a plane
to Harvard,

495
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,888
and you're gonna learn
everything there is

496
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:23,989
about going
to law school there.

497
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:25,023
Did you buy that suit?
Yeah.

498
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,791
Let's buy some new ones.

499
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:36,666
Hi.

500
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:39,235
How do I sign up
for today's law school tour?

501
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:41,437
You go back in time
six weeks

502
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:42,872
because
that's when it booked up.

503
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,574
Um...

504
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:46,943
This is Harvard Law.

505
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:49,046
We get over 7,000 applications
a year.

506
00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:52,550
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

507
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:54,886
Thank you.

508
00:23:54,954 --> 00:23:57,856
Eduardo Fernandez,
who, first of all,

509
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:00,626
looks like he works
at the public pool or something,

510
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:02,362
and he comes up to me
the other day,

511
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:03,663
and I completely know
he's a freshman.

512
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,064
And he looks at me
and he goes,

513
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,299
"Where's
the public health school?"

514
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:07,934
Which is right
around the corner,

515
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,235
and you know what I tell him?
Clifford Watkins?

516
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:10,904
Excuse me.

517
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:11,971
Can I help you?

518
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,706
Jonathan Atwater.

519
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:15,341
I work for Dean Wormer
in the Admissions Office.

520
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:17,610
Yes, of course.
What can I do for you?

521
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:19,379
Well, the Dean
personally sent me down here

522
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:21,681
to invite you
to a small cocktail hour

523
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:25,719
for some of
our more realistic candidates.

524
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:28,021
And we'd like to keep
this sort of thing discreet,

525
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,290
so if you'd subtly hand me
your name tag,

526
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:33,593
you can proceed
directly to the Dean's office.

527
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:35,562
Congratulations.

528
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:41,701
Harvard Law
is the oldest law school

529
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:43,369
in the country
and boasts

530
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:45,904
the most successful graduates
in the world.

531
00:24:45,972 --> 00:24:49,141
Currently, we are six
of nine Supreme Court Justices

532
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:51,744
and, of course, the President
of the United States.

533
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:08,029
[Alarm clock buzzing]

534
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:45,598
Uh, hi, good morning.

535
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:46,632
I'm here to see--
- Have a seat.

536
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:55,640
Thank you.

537
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,392
Mike Ross?

538
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,594
Hi, I'm Rachel Zane.

539
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,663
I'll be giving you
your orientation.

540
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,799
- Wow. You're pretty.
- Good. You've hit on me.

541
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:24,201
We can get it out of the way
that I am not interested.

542
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:25,336
No, I'm sorry.
I wasn't hitting on you.

543
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:26,403
Trust me.

544
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:28,005
I've given dozens of these,

545
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:29,940
and without fail,
whatever new hotshot it is

546
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:31,308
thinks that,
because I'm just a paralegal,

547
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:33,076
that I will
somehow be blown away

548
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:34,511
by his dazzling degree.

549
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,814
Let me assure you,
I won't.

550
00:26:36,882 --> 00:26:40,352
I was.
I was hitting on you.

551
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:42,187
You were.
Take notes.

552
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:43,455
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

553
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:46,826
I love you.

554
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:49,863
The firm operates
on a chain of command model.

555
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,465
Harvey's
your commanding officer.

556
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:53,333
However, Louis Litt,
he oversees all associates,

557
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,967
so you'll also answer
to him.

558
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:56,769
What do you think
about Harvey?

559
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:58,538
People are in awe of him.

560
00:26:58,606 --> 00:27:00,273
They say he's the best closer
there is,

561
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:01,608
but I have very little contact
with him,

562
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:02,809
so I don't know.

563
00:27:02,877 --> 00:27:05,178
And what about Louis Litt?

564
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:10,316
Let's continue
with your tour.

565
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:12,551
Hey, Becky.
You are glowing.

566
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,153
I wonder why that is.
Oh, yeah.

567
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:16,489
It's the day
they announce my promotion.

568
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:18,058
Jimmy, have you lost weight?

569
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:20,193
Steve-O.

570
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:22,930
Looking like a guy
who came to work.

571
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:25,233
Excuse me,
why are you scratching off

572
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,567
the senior off my door?

573
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:28,569
I got a work order
to take it off.

574
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:30,571
- Who issued the work order?
- My supervisor.

575
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:32,574
Why did he issue
the work order?

576
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:34,576
If I knew that,
I'd be his supervisor.

577
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:36,444
You seem
to be enjoying yourself.

578
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:38,847
I haven't enjoyed myself
since 2004.

579
00:27:38,915 --> 00:27:40,682
Donna!

580
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,251
Someone's trying to have
a little fun with me here.

581
00:27:43,318 --> 00:27:45,954
Jessica wants to see you
in her office.

582
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:47,722
Now.

583
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:53,594
And finally,
this is where you'll live.

584
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:55,430
[Laughs]
Wow.

585
00:27:55,497 --> 00:27:57,598
I gave you that for a reason.
You haven't taken one note.

586
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:58,833
- That's because--
- Because you were

587
00:27:58,901 --> 00:28:00,468
too busy ogling me to listen

588
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:01,769
to a word I've said?

589
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:06,274
Partners' offices
anchor the wings.

590
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:08,910
Fifth floor's research,
sixth is security.

591
00:28:08,977 --> 00:28:11,613
All work gets billed,
even if it's finding an address.

592
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,981
I answer to Harvey

593
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:14,650
and Louis Litt,
and, judging by the way

594
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:16,419
you responded to my questions,

595
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,088
I should admire Harvey
and I should fear Louis.

596
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,790
You have been here
for five years,

597
00:28:20,857 --> 00:28:22,224
and just because I outrank you

598
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:23,392
does not mean
I have the authority

599
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,627
to command your services.

600
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:26,062
Oh, it's also pretty clear

601
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:27,497
that you think
you're too smart

602
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:28,631
to be a paralegal.

603
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:31,001
You know what nobody likes?

604
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:32,736
Nobody likes a showoff.

605
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:36,106
You used the word "ogling."

606
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,275
When do I get
to see Harvey?

607
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,577
Gerald Tate
fired the firm.

608
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:42,780
So you're taking
my promotion away.

609
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:45,649
You know, most firms would put
you in front of the bar

610
00:28:45,717 --> 00:28:47,284
and have your license stripped.

611
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,086
You lied to a client,
and he figured it out.

612
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:51,489
I lied to him to get him
to do the right thing

613
00:28:51,556 --> 00:28:53,057
and honor his goddamn contract.

614
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,325
And you didn't seem
to mind so much

615
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:55,626
when you thought
I got away with it.

616
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,828
But you didn't get away
with it.

617
00:28:57,896 --> 00:29:00,265
And I can't justify handing you
a promotion

618
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:01,633
on the same day that you lose
a huge client.

619
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,269
One client
doesn't make a firm.

620
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:05,771
I don't know
if you've noticed,

621
00:29:05,838 --> 00:29:08,140
but we're in the middle
of an economic meltdown.

622
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,575
Companies
aren't exactly lining up

623
00:29:09,642 --> 00:29:11,443
to spend money
on attorneys right now.

624
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:14,546
And, you know, Gerald might
have forgiven the lying

625
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:16,881
had you not humiliated him.

626
00:29:16,949 --> 00:29:19,350
But you did,
and you need to accept that.

627
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:25,423
Jessica, if you hadn't done
as much for me as you have,

628
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,458
I'd be heading
for the door.

629
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:30,194
If I hadn't done as much
for you as I have,

630
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:32,062
I'd be throwing you
out the window.

631
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,167
But, Harvey,
no more shenanigans.

632
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,070
You do one more thing
that isn't straight as an arrow,

633
00:29:39,138 --> 00:29:41,139
and instead
of covering your ass,

634
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:42,674
I will put you
in front of the bar myself.

635
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,381
- Mike.
- Hey.

636
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:50,950
Who's ready
for a great first day?

637
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:52,852
I'm gonna have
to let you go.

638
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,886
- What?
- I just got reamed

639
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:55,488
for lying to a client,

640
00:29:55,556 --> 00:29:57,156
and if they find out
that I lied about you

641
00:29:57,224 --> 00:29:58,491
going to Harvard,
they'll take away my license.

642
00:29:58,558 --> 00:29:59,759
[Beep]
[Over intercom] You what?

643
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:02,327
Not now, Donna.

644
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:03,895
Look, I have to put
my own interests

645
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:05,397
above yours.
It's nothing personal.

646
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:07,999
You're fired.

647
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:11,468
Wait, so you're worried
that if I stay,

648
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:14,805
then they might find out
that you lied about me

649
00:30:14,873 --> 00:30:17,208
and you'll lose your license.

650
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:19,477
But if you fire me,
then I could tell them

651
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:21,113
that you lied about me,

652
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,681
and you'd definitely lose
your license.

653
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:25,318
Are you telling me that

654
00:30:25,385 --> 00:30:26,853
if I throw you under the bus,

655
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,287
you're gonna drag me
with you?

656
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:30,323
You put your interests
above mine,

657
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:33,893
and I'm just putting mine
back up next to yours.

658
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:37,096
You're rehired.

659
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,901
So should I--
all right.

660
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:44,437
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna give me back

661
00:30:44,504 --> 00:30:45,804
my promotion,
and that's the last

662
00:30:45,872 --> 00:30:46,972
we're gonna talk about this.

663
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,673
And why is that?

664
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:50,508
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna go across town

665
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:52,343
and join Rick Peterson.

666
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:54,312
I'm gonna approach every client
I've ever closed,

667
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,181
and I'm gonna
take them with me.

668
00:30:56,248 --> 00:30:57,983
You do that,
and you'll force me

669
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,551
to put you in front
of the ethics board.

670
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:01,286
- I don't think you will.
- And why not?

671
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:02,922
Because you were obligated
to notify them

672
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:05,057
the second I lied to Gerald,
but you didn't.

673
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,826
You put me in front
of the board right now,

674
00:31:06,894 --> 00:31:08,161
I'll put you right up there
with me.

675
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:10,731
Hmm.

676
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:19,140
I'll...I'll give you
your promotion.

677
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,909
But you have to do something
for me.

678
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:22,143
Anything.

679
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:24,479
Ah.
Pro bono.

680
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:25,580
Anything but that.

681
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:27,149
Harvey, pro bono cases

682
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:28,985
are how we, as a firm,
show that we care

683
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:30,519
about more
than just ourselves.

684
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:32,788
I'm not saying
we shouldn't do them.

685
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:34,290
I'm saying
I shouldn't do them.

686
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:35,858
And it's how you can show me

687
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:38,360
that you care about more
than just yourself.

688
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:40,663
You'll handle this yourself.

689
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:42,031
You will not pass it off.

690
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,633
Absolutely.

691
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:49,039
Your first case.

692
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:50,073
Awesome.
What is it?

693
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,075
Pro bono.

694
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,677
Sexual harassment.

695
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,779
Don't tell anyone
I laid it off on you,

696
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,614
and don't screw it up.
Got it.

697
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,651
You can't handle it.
I'll knock it out of the park.

698
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,753
Easy, Clarence Thomas.
Just go meet the client.

699
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:04,857
Hey. Didn't I tell you
to get some better suits?

700
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:06,959
I spent $500.

701
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:08,895
For how many suits?

702
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:11,197
Five.

703
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,598
What?

704
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,200
Nancy?

705
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:15,868
- Mike?
- Yeah, hi.

706
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,173
You're a kid.

707
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,241
No, I'm a--
I'm a grown man.

708
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:25,044
You're so skinny.
Have a grape.

709
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:27,747
Thank you.

710
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:29,782
Why don't you tell me
your story?

711
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:31,483
It started two years ago.

712
00:32:31,551 --> 00:32:32,951
I was a stay-at-home mom

713
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,920
to my son, Freddie.

714
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,821
And one day
we were at little league,

715
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,456
Freddie was five.

716
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,890
He really hated
that he couldn't play

717
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,292
with the older kids.

718
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,860
It was the third inning,
and I got a phone call.

719
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,195
My husband had been
in a car accident,

720
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,264
and he was gone,
just like that.

721
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:50,633
I'm so sorry.

722
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:53,737
I did the best I could.

723
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,606
I got myself a job
as a secretary

724
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:56,974
at Devlin McGreggor.

725
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,242
And I even got promoted

726
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,510
to secretary of the president,

727
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,612
Charles Hunt.

728
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,749
And that's
when it all changed.

729
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,151
It's okay.
Tell me what happened.

730
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,387
He started asking me
to stay late,

731
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:12,557
order in dinners together,
stuff like that.

732
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,927
One night, he says
that if I sleep with him,

733
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,362
he's gonna take care of me
in the firm,

734
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:18,964
and, if I don't,
he's gonna fire me.

735
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,199
So what did you do?

736
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,534
I went to Human Resources.

737
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,503
They said they investigated,

738
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:25,972
couldn't find anything
to support my claim.

739
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,507
Two months later,
I was fired

740
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:29,276
for poor job performance.

741
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,945
They wouldn't let me
say good-bye to anybody.

742
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:33,314
They wouldn't write me
a letter of recommendation.

743
00:33:33,382 --> 00:33:34,983
I wasn't looking
for a payoff.

744
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,451
All I wanted
was for it to stop.

745
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,386
Can you help me?

746
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:42,389
Uh, yes.

747
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:44,791
Yes, I can.

748
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,326
What do you need
my help for?

749
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:48,428
- Wait, can I just--
- No, give me the update.

750
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:50,730
You know,
she's a nice woman.

751
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:52,165
She--
- On the case.

752
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:53,633
I don't get
emotionally attached

753
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,034
to the client.

754
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:56,837
This woman had
her life ripped apart.

755
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:58,439
You don't even care?

756
00:33:58,507 --> 00:34:00,141
I'm not about caring.
I'm about winning.

757
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:02,010
Why can't you be
about both?

758
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:03,578
I'd explain it to you,

759
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:06,881
but then I'd have
to care about you.

760
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:08,516
What are you doing?

761
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:09,751
Don't touch that.

762
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,519
I'm just checking my lock.

763
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:14,689
You ride your bike to...

764
00:34:14,757 --> 00:34:15,724
It's locked, okay?

765
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,325
Come on.

766
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:24,299
Defense sent over
the investigation files

767
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,901
as a courtesy.
No, they didn't.

768
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:27,369
Nobody does anything
as a courtesy.

769
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:29,004
They sent those files

770
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:30,205
because that's
where they want you to look.

771
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:31,507
Listen, being a lawyer's

772
00:34:31,574 --> 00:34:33,475
like being a doctor.

773
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:34,876
You mean how you don't get
emotional about the client?

774
00:34:34,944 --> 00:34:37,079
No, I mean you keep pressing
until it hurts.

775
00:34:37,146 --> 00:34:38,580
Then you know
where to look.

776
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,315
Forget about impeaching
the investigation.

777
00:34:40,383 --> 00:34:42,117
It won't lead anywhere.
No employee's gonna testify

778
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:43,618
against their own CEO.
Okay.

779
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:45,487
So what do you suggest I do?

780
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:47,556
Think.
This guy's done this once...

781
00:34:47,623 --> 00:34:49,357
He's done it before.

782
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:50,792
And if the people
who work for him now

783
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,294
won't testify against him...

784
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:54,896
Someone who used
to work for him might.

785
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:56,397
You know what,

786
00:34:56,465 --> 00:34:58,099
I'd subpoena
the personnel records

787
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,634
of every woman
who's left the firm

788
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:01,203
during this guy's tenure.
That's funny.

789
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,804
That's exactly what I thought.

790
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:04,339
Then what do you need
my help for?

791
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:06,808
I don't know
how to fill out a subpoena.

792
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:11,680
Figure it out yourself.

793
00:35:11,747 --> 00:35:13,882
Donna, can you show me
how to fill out a subpoena?

794
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,450
Absolutely.
And after that,

795
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:16,985
you want me to show you
how to wipe your ass?

796
00:35:17,053 --> 00:35:18,052
It's funny,
because you should already know

797
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,420
how to do both those things.

798
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:21,322
Ha, yeah,
that's hilarious.

799
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,425
What's that?
That's my suit guy.

800
00:35:23,492 --> 00:35:25,627
Go in, tell him I sent you,
and spend some money.

801
00:35:25,694 --> 00:35:28,063
What does it matter
how much money I spend on suits?

802
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,665
People respond
to how we're dressed,

803
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:31,233
so like it or not,
this is what you have to do.

804
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:33,235
That's weird,
you giving me advice.

805
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:35,671
It sounds like you actually care
about me.

806
00:35:35,738 --> 00:35:37,539
I don't.
You're a reflection of me,

807
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:39,342
and I absolutely
care about me.

808
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:41,677
So get your skinny tie
out of my face and get to work.

809
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:45,981
That was a little harsh.

810
00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:47,549
Really?

811
00:35:47,617 --> 00:35:50,318
Yeah.

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,561
Where are you going?

814
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:03,263
It's 6:30.
I'm going home.

815
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:04,498
[Laughs]

816
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:06,099
Okay.
What's so funny?

817
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,734
You're a rookie associate.

818
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:10,269
If you go home before 9:00
on your first week,

819
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,405
you're not gonna make it
through your first month.

820
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:13,872
And Louis Litt
wants to see you.

821
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,875
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

822
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:18,411
This tie,
is it too skinny?

823
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:19,645
Yeah.

824
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:22,715
Right.

825
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:24,683
Yeah.

826
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:34,494
I know you had orientation
from Rachel,

827
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:38,365
but I wanted to give you
a special welcome from me.

828
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:42,703
Amongst other things,
I'm sort of the disciplinarian

829
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,704
of the associates.

[Tap on glass]

00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:49,009

- Yes.

832
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:51,478
Gary, please come in.
Mike, this is Gary Lipsky.

833
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:53,413
Gary's one of our most promising
associates from last year.

834
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,181
Hi.

835
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:57,951
Gary, Ms. Pearson
wanted me to ask,

836
00:36:58,019 --> 00:36:59,486
have you completed
the Petramco filing?

837
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:01,187
Well, my brother was in
over the weekend,

838
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:02,389
so I didn't really get
to it.

839
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:04,157
Look, I mean,
Gary, come on.

840
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:05,325
This is, like, the third time
I've had to ask.

841
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:06,793
I'll get right on it.

842
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,562
Don't bother.
You're fired.

843
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:10,497
What?
You can't fire me.

844
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:12,132
Oh, yes, I can.
And I just did.

845
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,834
Go pack up your things.

846
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,070
Don't you ever show your face
in this place again.

847
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:26,313
See, I arranged
for you to see that

848
00:37:26,381 --> 00:37:28,849
because we pay our associates
very well

849
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:31,685
and we provide the opportunity
for unlimited advancement.

850
00:37:31,753 --> 00:37:35,189
But in return
we expect results.

851
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:39,895
Have I made myself clear?

852
00:37:39,963 --> 00:37:42,130
Yeah.

853
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,035
Great.

Okay, I have two words
for you.

Absolutely beautiful.

You think you're the only one
who can charm a client?

860
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:12,327
Categorically stunning.

861

How's the new kid
working out?

862

Ah, yeah,
because you set me up.

the whole story.

You knew there were risks
when you quoted that crap

from that book.

876
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:50,966
Okay, you needed money,

00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,368

with an opportunity

Oh, really?

00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,175
And why did they do that?

883
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:00,442
To keep me from warning you.

That makes me very happy,

to find out

that you weren't putting in
your full effort,

I'd be very upset.

No worries.
We're all good.

There's a hearing
on my subpoena.

I've got three cases
in front of you,

to wait in line.

So why are you
coming to me?

936
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,151
Because Donna says

you're the best researcher
in the firm.

938

Let me see the motion.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

940
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,693
You have an office?

941

How do you have an office
and I have a cubicle?

942
00:41:27,497 --> 00:41:29,631
Like you said,
I'm the best researcher

943
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,466
in the firm.
Really?

944
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:33,034
I just made that up.

945
00:41:33,102 --> 00:41:35,503
I didn't even have time
to talk to Donna.

946
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:38,572

to you?

She's got
nowhere else to turn--

953
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:52,155
And you can't help her
by yourself.

954
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:54,457
I can.

955
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:57,360
I just prefer not to.

956
00:41:57,428 --> 00:42:00,864
Okay.

957
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,265
You're asking to look
at private files

958
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,700
without any evidence
of your assertion.

959
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:04,868
Yeah, but the only way
that we can find

960
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:06,669
the evidence is to look
at those files.

961
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:07,670
It's a rickety argument.

962
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:09,839
But is there a precedent?

963
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:13,643
Let's go see
if we can find one.

964
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:16,212
Research is as much art
as science,

965
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,915
so we're gonna look
at privacy and harassment law

966
00:42:18,982 --> 00:42:21,284
so you can find a combination
of cases

967
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:23,085
to make an argument.
I'll take privacy.

968
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:24,720
I'll take harassment law.

969
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:26,289
This'll take a while.

970
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,958
We're gonna need dinner.

971
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:30,094
- Chinese.
- No.

972
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:31,529
I can afford Chinese
on my own.

973
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:33,330
This is on the firm.
I want Sushi.

974
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:35,033
Ooh.

975
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,235
So they told me to put
my top investigator on it.

976
00:42:37,303 --> 00:42:39,538
- What did you do?
- What could I do?

977
00:42:39,606 --> 00:42:41,306

Vanessa, why don't we do this
more often?

983

'Cause it always ends
the same way.

984

doing it now?

985
00:42:55,054 --> 00:42:57,456
Harvey,
I don't sleep around.

986
00:42:57,523 --> 00:42:59,891
And I could never be
in a relationship with you.

987
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:02,127
All you ever think about
is yourself.

988
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:04,762
I'm thinking about you and me
right now.

989
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:10,436
Please.
I insist.

990
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,637
But I'm a gentleman.

991
00:43:11,705 --> 00:43:13,806
Besides, you came through

992
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:15,709
on Dockery for me,
and I'm not one

993
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:17,611
to forget a favor.

994
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,613
Neither am I.

995
00:43:25,754 --> 00:43:28,422

[Laughter]

997
00:43:33,461 --> 00:43:36,664
You remember when I said
you thought you were too smart

998
00:43:36,732 --> 00:43:37,965
to be a paralegal?
- Mm-hmm.

999
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,067
- Why...
- Aren't I a lawyer?

1000
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:42,136
Mm.

1001
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,738
I don't test well.
What?

1002
00:43:44,806 --> 00:43:46,841
I am smart.

1003
00:43:46,908 --> 00:43:48,476
And I know
I'd be a good lawyer.

1004
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,911
I just--I don't know
what it is.

1005
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:50,878
I can't take tests,

1006
00:43:50,946 --> 00:43:53,914
and I bombed the LSATs.

1007
00:43:53,982 --> 00:43:55,349
And even if I could get

1008
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:56,550
into law school,
there's no way

1009
00:43:56,618 --> 00:43:58,486
I'd pass the bar.

1010
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:03,090
So if only there was someone
who could take the test for me.

1011
00:44:03,158 --> 00:44:05,459
- Yeah, if only there were.
- Yeah.

1012
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:08,330
Hi. Where are you at
with the research

1013
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,732
for tomorrow's hearing?
Nothing yet.

1014
00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:11,733
You say you care
about the client,

1015
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:13,168
but if you keep playing footsie

1016
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:14,770
instead of finding me
an argument,

1017
00:44:14,837 --> 00:44:16,471
the client's gonna lose.

1018
00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:18,040
I don't want to lose.

1019
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:20,275
Ugh.

Look, it's no use.

1021
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:26,148
Okay, their investigation's
by the book.

1022
00:44:26,216 --> 00:44:27,482
We look like the bad guys
coming in,

1023
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,883
putting them under duress.

1024
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:30,686
What did you just say?

1025
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:32,053
I said we look
like the bad guys.

1026
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:33,955
No, you said

1027
00:44:34,023 --> 00:44:35,523
they did it by the book

1028
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:37,225
and we're putting them
under duress.

1029
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:41,964
Yeah.

1030

I get to go?

1033

You didn't think
I'd let you come along?

1034
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:53,010
- No.
- Good instinct. I wasn't.

1035
00:44:53,078 --> 00:44:54,546
But then I thought
it'd be cruel

1036
00:44:54,613 --> 00:44:56,281
not to let you witness
my greatness.

1037
00:44:56,348 --> 00:44:58,583
- Okay, can I go get my bag?
- No.

1038
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:00,452
- You're a true giver.
- Other side.

1039
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,555
Okay.

1040
00:45:03,623 --> 00:45:05,624
Your honor, this case
should be thrown out.

1041
00:45:05,691 --> 00:45:07,459
Other than her story,
the plaintiff doesn't have

1042
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:09,395
one piece of evidence.

1043
00:45:09,463 --> 00:45:11,531
Because the evidence lies
within their personnel files,

1044
00:45:11,598 --> 00:45:14,167
which they're conveniently
refusing to hand over.

1045

sensitive information.

1050

to rats' asses.

Your honor, Mr. Specter's
claim that we don't care

1052
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:30,716
about our employees,
though belittling,

1053
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:33,219
doesn't carry any weight
as a rule of law.

1054
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:35,622
True, but what does carry
weight is that an investigation

1055
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,357
of sexual harassment
must be conducted

1056
00:45:37,424 --> 00:45:38,658
without any duress.

1057
00:45:38,726 --> 00:45:39,960
Your point?

1058
00:45:40,027 --> 00:45:41,961
The investigator
and every person

1061

That is the definition
of duress.

1062
00:45:50,304 --> 00:45:51,538
It'd be as if your bailiff

1063
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:53,940
accused you of sexual harassment

1064
00:45:54,008 --> 00:45:55,475
and you assigned
your stenographer

1065
00:45:55,543 --> 00:45:57,744
to investigate.

1066
00:45:57,812 --> 00:45:59,213
Now how likely would it be

1067
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,315
that this investigation
yielded any fruit?

1068
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,419

I would harass Herman?

Herman would come to me

to an investigation.

That should be stricken.

But what if Herman did come
to you, your honor?

1075
00:46:19,968 --> 00:46:21,802

under false pretenses?

00:54:29,123 --> 00:54:32,092
where, by the way,
you jerked off the entire time

1280
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,163
you were there,
and I still hired you.

1281
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,232
And you've benefited
from that ever since.

1282
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:39,167
Look, I closed the Dockery case,
okay.

1283
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:41,102
You made a promise to me.

1284
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:44,706
You broke it, and then you lied
to my face.

1285
00:54:44,774 --> 00:54:47,776
So let me be clear.
This isn't professional.

1286
00:54:47,844 --> 00:54:49,411
This is personal.

1287
00:54:49,478 --> 00:54:51,145
And I'll tell you
something else.

1288
00:54:51,213 --> 00:54:55,182
You made your bed,
you better goddamn win.

1289
00:55:09,164 --> 00:55:12,200
God damn it.

1290
00:55:22,213 --> 00:55:25,081
What the hell is wrong with you?
I need the briefcase back.

1291
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:26,616
Oh, so that's what this
has been about, huh?

1292
00:55:26,684 --> 00:55:28,685
You don't care
about our friendship at all.

1293
00:55:28,752 --> 00:55:30,319
You're my oldest friend,
and you know it.

1294
00:55:30,387 --> 00:55:32,555
But you don't seem
to care about that anymore,

1295
00:55:32,623 --> 00:55:34,156
and, yeah, I need
the briefcase back.

1296
00:55:34,224 --> 00:55:35,891
And I'm gonna find it, Mike.

1297
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:37,394
Well, I ditched it
when I was running away

1298
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:40,363
from the cops
that you sent me into.

1299
00:56:04,374 --> 00:56:06,675
Mike.

1300
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:08,344
Where you going?

1301
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,780
To my cubicle.

1302
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:13,817
No, you're not.
It's pee in a cup time.

1303
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:15,649
I'm sorry. What?

1304
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,018
Drug test.
Follow me.

1305
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:21,122
I'm just gonna put my stuff
back--

1306
00:56:21,189 --> 00:56:23,057
Now.

1307
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,203
Oh, by the way, my cousin
was your year at Harvard.

1308
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:36,439
And I asked him
if he knew you.

1309
00:56:36,506 --> 00:56:38,875
It's so funny.
He didn't.

1310
00:56:38,943 --> 00:56:40,209
Well, what's his name?

1311
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:41,510
Mitch Samberg.

1312
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:43,245
Yeah.
Don't know him.

1313
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:45,881
It's a big school.

1314
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:47,950
Not really.

1315
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:50,719
We get 7,000 applications
a year.

1316
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:53,022
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

1317
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:55,024
Oh, Mitchell.

1318
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:56,525
With the slicked back hair,

1319
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:58,027
graduated seventh in the class.

1320
00:56:58,095 --> 00:57:00,129
Sure. Yeah.
I remember him.

1321
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:03,440
Time to face the music.

1322
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:09,310
<i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

1323
00:57:09,336 --> 00:57:10,698
I got to get
to the Kendrick filing.

1324
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:11,799
Where the hell is Mike?

1325
00:57:12,007 --> 00:57:15,710
I don't know.

1326
00:57:15,778 --> 00:57:17,713
Leave the cup
on the counter.

1327
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:23,586
You'll have to leave that
out here.

1328
00:57:23,654 --> 00:57:26,022
- Why?
- If you take it in there

1329
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:27,323
with you, I have to check
to make sure you don't have

1330
00:57:27,391 --> 00:57:28,525
another urine sample in it.

1331
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:31,728
[Laughs]

1332
00:58:11,903 --> 00:58:15,004
- Where you been?
- Hi. Um...

1333
00:58:15,072 --> 00:58:16,539
Getting drug tested, actually.

1334
00:58:16,607 --> 00:58:19,208
The deposition's
this afternoon.

1335
00:58:19,276 --> 00:58:21,077
Before they get here, I want you
to grill this woman

1336
00:58:21,145 --> 00:58:22,545
about her background
for anything they might use

1337
00:58:22,613 --> 00:58:23,746
against her.

1338
00:58:23,814 --> 00:58:25,514
You got it?
Got it.

1339
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:27,048
- Make her tell you everything.
- Everything.

1340
00:58:27,116 --> 00:58:28,150
- Everything.
- Everything.

1341
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:31,019
- Okay.
- Okay.

1342
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:41,830
I had been working six months

1343
00:58:41,898 --> 00:58:44,667
when Mr. Hunt started asking me
to work more,

1344
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:46,535
order dinner.

1345
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:51,241
One night, late, he tried
to have sex with me.

1346
00:58:51,308 --> 00:58:55,212
The next day, I requested
a change in assignment.

1347
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,915
Two months later I was fired
for having a bad attitude.

1348
00:58:58,983 --> 00:59:01,518
This is ridiculous.

1349
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:03,185
Wipe that smirk
off your face.

1350
00:59:03,253 --> 00:59:04,687
You're not even supposed
to be here.

1351
00:59:04,754 --> 00:59:07,356
Mr. Hunt has every right
to be here.

1352
00:59:07,424 --> 00:59:11,627
Now, Ms. Webster, after working
for Devlin McGreggor,

1353
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:14,296
you then went on to waitress
at Hooters, right?

1354
00:59:14,363 --> 00:59:17,299
- Yes, I did.
- A place that advertises

1355
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:19,734
the sexuality
of its waitstaff, correct?

1356
00:59:19,802 --> 00:59:22,003
You will have
to ask them that.

1357
00:59:22,071 --> 00:59:23,939
I'm asking you.

1358
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:28,110
And she's not answering.
Move on.

1359
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:33,449
Ms. Webster, would you say
that you're a truthful person?

1360
00:59:33,516 --> 00:59:36,051
Yes.

1361
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:38,721
So when you said earlier
that you had never been arrested

1362
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:41,891
for a crime, you were speaking
the truth?

1363
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:45,261
- Yes.
- Yes, so in 1993 then

1364
00:59:45,329 --> 00:59:49,099
you were not arrested for
stealing $1,000 worth of jewelry

1365
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:52,402
from the Willow Grove Mall
in Pennsylvania?

1366
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:56,806
I was 17.
That was one mistake.

1367
00:59:56,874 --> 00:59:58,908
Those records were supposed
to be sealed.

1368
00:59:58,976 --> 01:00:00,877
So when you say
those records were sealed,

1369
01:00:00,945 --> 01:00:02,345
what you mean to say
is you thought

1370
01:00:02,413 --> 01:00:03,380
you could get away
with a lie?

1371
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,081
No, that's not it.

1372
01:00:05,149 --> 01:00:07,082
You're making it seem
different that it is.

1373
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,852
I'm sorry.
You were arrested in your past

1374
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,588
and you lied about it here
under oath.

1375
01:00:11,655 --> 01:00:13,690
Is that
making it seem different

1376
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:15,592
than what it is?

1377
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:21,531
No answer.
Hmm, all right.

1378
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,167
Let me ask you this,
since you've lied here once,

1379
01:00:24,235 --> 01:00:26,903
what's to make us believe
you're not lying about Mr. Hunt?

1380
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:41,818
How the hell did you miss
that arrest?

1381
01:00:41,886 --> 01:00:43,954
I did every background check
we have.

1382
01:00:44,021 --> 01:00:45,122
Did you grill her
like I told you to?

1383
01:00:45,189 --> 01:00:46,757
It was a sealed record,
Harvey!

1384
01:00:46,824 --> 01:00:47,757
Goddamn it, I knew it.

1385
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:49,560
Fix it.

1386
01:00:49,627 --> 01:00:52,495
Joanna!
Wait. Please!

1387
01:00:52,563 --> 01:00:54,231
This is why I didn't want
to testify.

1388
01:00:54,298 --> 01:00:55,765
They twist something
from 100 years ago

1389
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:58,034
and make me look like a liar.

1390
01:00:58,102 --> 01:00:59,202
They make it sound
like what he did

1391
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:00,803
to me didn't happen.

1392
01:01:00,871 --> 01:01:02,338
It doesn't matter.
All right?

1393
01:01:02,406 --> 01:01:03,739
I just--I need you
to testify on Friday

1394
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:05,574
and keep this case alive.

1395
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:07,276
We don't have time to find
anyone else before--

1396
01:01:07,344 --> 01:01:08,544
would you please wait?

1397
01:01:08,612 --> 01:01:10,346
No. I'm not waiting.

1398
01:01:10,414 --> 01:01:11,814
You promised this
wouldn't happen, and it did.

1399
01:01:11,882 --> 01:01:14,316
You never told me
you were arrested.

1400
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:17,052
Don't contact me again,
please.

1401
01:01:54,888 --> 01:01:57,590
What happened
with the witness?

1402
01:01:57,657 --> 01:02:01,527
Nothing. Nothing happened.
I couldn't fix it.

1403
01:02:01,595 --> 01:02:04,497
So you're going to quit?

1404
01:02:04,565 --> 01:02:06,900
It's either that
or have Louis Litt fire me.

1405
01:02:06,968 --> 01:02:08,435
What are you talking about?

1406
01:02:08,503 --> 01:02:10,671
My first day,
Louis fired Gary Lipsky

1407
01:02:10,738 --> 01:02:12,339
for screwing up a case.

1408
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:13,974
He said
if I did the same thing

1409
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:16,077
I'd be gone just as fast.

1410
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:17,445
Well, you go back
to the witness' house

1411
01:02:17,513 --> 01:02:19,213
and you get her
to testify again.

1412
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:21,149
- I tried. There's no way.
- There's always a way.

1413
01:02:21,216 --> 01:02:22,650
Then why don't you go
and convince her?

1414
01:02:22,718 --> 01:02:24,386
Because you screwed it up.

1415
01:02:24,454 --> 01:02:26,488
Oh, and you don't give
a damn about the client. Right.

1416
01:02:26,556 --> 01:02:28,291
- That's not my job.
- Does your job

1417
01:02:28,358 --> 01:02:29,692
include giving a damn
about me?

1418
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,294
Because the least
you could do is offer

1419
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:32,962
to stand up to Louis for me.
Stand up for you?

1420
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,331
I put my ass
on the line for you,

1421
01:02:34,399 --> 01:02:35,833
but it turns out
you may have had the balls

1422
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,801
to get this job,
but you don't have the courage

1423
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:39,503
to stick it out
when it gets tough.

1424
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:40,938
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

1425
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:42,640
You've had one foot
out the door

1426
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,475
since you got here.
What are you talking about?

1427
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:45,810
I'm talking
about that briefcase

1428
01:02:45,877 --> 01:02:47,512
being locked in your desk.
Yeah, I saw it.

1429
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:49,480
And I know what it is.

1430
01:02:49,547 --> 01:02:51,816
It's your backup plan
in case this doesn't work out.

1431
01:02:51,883 --> 01:02:53,650
You can make some quick cash
and go right back

1432
01:02:53,718 --> 01:02:55,953
to the life you told me
you didn't want to lead.

1433
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,689
So if you want to quit,
go ahead.

1434
01:02:58,757 --> 01:03:01,658
But this isn't because of Louis,
and it isn't because of me.

1435
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:03,260
It's because you're afraid
you might have to admit

1436
01:03:03,328 --> 01:03:05,496
that you're not
as smart as you think you are.

1437
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:10,034
If you're here in the morning,

1438
01:03:10,102 --> 01:03:11,836
I'll know
I still have an associate.

1439
01:04:04,189 --> 01:04:06,925
Hey, I get
that you were upset

1440
01:04:06,992 --> 01:04:08,560
that I was promoted
before you,

1441
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:10,929
but if you ever threaten to fire
one of my guys again,

1442
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:13,364
I am going to kick your ass.

1443
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:16,801
Hmm.
What are you talking about?

1444
01:04:16,868 --> 01:04:18,669
Don't play dumb with me,
all right?

1445
01:04:18,737 --> 01:04:22,774
You fired Gary Lipsky
in front of Mike Ross.

1446
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:25,477
What's so funny?

1447
01:04:25,544 --> 01:04:27,846
Gary Lipsky works
in the mail room.

1448
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:32,017
- What?
- I didn't fire anyone.

1449
01:04:32,084 --> 01:04:33,218
That's how I let
the new associates know

1450
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,119
what's expected of them.

1451
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:39,024
- You plant a fake employee
to manipulate the assoc--

1452
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:40,258
that's it.

1453
01:04:40,326 --> 01:04:42,460
What?

1454
01:05:07,089 --> 01:05:09,757
Michael.

1455
01:05:09,825 --> 01:05:13,327
I want to quit.

1456
01:05:13,395 --> 01:05:16,597
Come here.

1457
01:05:25,607 --> 01:05:27,875
When your parents died,

1458
01:05:27,943 --> 01:05:32,480
I lost
my son and my daughter-in-law.

1459
01:05:32,548 --> 01:05:38,420
I was scared, alone,
and I was too old to raise you.

1460
01:05:38,487 --> 01:05:40,322
But I had no choice.

1461
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:46,129
Because who else was going
to care of my grandson?

1462
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:49,900
You made me a promise before.

1463
01:05:49,968 --> 01:05:53,337
You're in the door.

1464
01:05:53,405 --> 01:05:56,107
Promise me now the only way
you'll leave

1465
01:05:56,175 --> 01:05:59,477
is if they rip you out.

1466
01:06:11,557 --> 01:06:13,091
You can save your breath.

1467
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:14,259
There's no way I'm testifying

1468
01:06:14,326 --> 01:06:15,993
at the hearing tomorrow.

1469
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:18,563
That's not why I'm here.

1470
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,898
- I know what you did.
- What are you talking about?

1471
01:06:20,966 --> 01:06:23,067
You never worked
for Devlin McGreggor,

1472
01:06:23,134 --> 01:06:25,202
and you were never harassed
by Mr. Hunt.

1473
01:06:25,269 --> 01:06:27,170
- That's a l--
- Now I could tell you

1474
01:06:27,238 --> 01:06:29,472
that I've got the canceled
checks or the wire transfer

1475
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:32,341
or whatever smoking gun
that exists--I don't.

1476
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:33,842
But I will.
And when I do,

1477
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,410
you'll be going to jail
unless you tell me

1478
01:06:35,478 --> 01:06:37,846
what happened right now.

1479
01:06:39,549 --> 01:06:41,683
I'm the guy you tell.

1480
01:06:44,754 --> 01:06:47,690
All I had to do was waste
your time until tomorrow

1481
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:49,558
after the hearing.

1482
01:06:49,626 --> 01:06:53,596
Please,
I just needed the money.

1483
01:06:53,664 --> 01:06:55,899
I don't want to go to jail.

1484
01:06:55,966 --> 01:06:59,669
Here's what you're gonna do...

1485
01:06:59,737 --> 01:07:02,605
Did you call
this place before?

1486
01:07:02,673 --> 01:07:04,374
Mike!

1487
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:05,475
- Hey.
- I'm not giving this to you

1488
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:07,243
because you need it.

1489
01:07:07,311 --> 01:07:10,312
I'm giving it to you
because I don't.

1490
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:12,815
And I don't know if I'm ready
to forgive you yet or not,

1491
01:07:12,883 --> 01:07:15,484
but I do know we're even.

1492
01:07:15,552 --> 01:07:19,288
Wait a second.

1493
01:07:22,525 --> 01:07:24,493
I...
[Scoffs]

1494
01:07:24,561 --> 01:07:26,361
Well...

1495
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:29,198
[Sighs]

1496
01:07:29,266 --> 01:07:30,466
[Laughs]

1497
01:07:32,702 --> 01:07:34,703
Don't.

1498
01:07:34,771 --> 01:07:35,738
Now we're even.

1499
01:07:39,744 --> 01:07:40,744
Huh.

1500
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:57,629
I see you came to work today.
Nice suit.

1501
01:07:57,696 --> 01:08:00,264
It was a barter transaction.

1502
01:08:00,332 --> 01:08:03,300
I got six of them
for one little briefcase.

1503
01:08:06,337 --> 01:08:10,006
Listen...

1504
01:08:10,073 --> 01:08:12,008
I'm sorry and--

1505
01:08:12,075 --> 01:08:14,677
Forget it.

1506
01:08:14,745 --> 01:08:18,514
When I first started,
Jessica rode me so hard...

1507
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:20,516
I quit once a month.

1508
01:08:20,584 --> 01:08:23,519
I just told you
what you needed to hear.

1509
01:08:23,586 --> 01:08:26,522
That's just it.
I've only ever had one person

1510
01:08:26,589 --> 01:08:30,292
who told me
what I needed to hear.

1511
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:33,428
Maybe it's time I started
trusting somebody else.

1512
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:44,971
Merry Christmas.

1513
01:08:49,843 --> 01:08:50,909
Is this for real?

1514
01:08:50,977 --> 01:08:53,612
You know what to do.

1515
01:08:54,814 --> 01:08:57,416
Press until it hurts.

1516
01:08:57,484 --> 01:09:02,087
Wire transfer from your
account to Joanna Webster's,

1517
01:09:02,154 --> 01:09:04,522
phone records
with Joanna Webster

1518
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:06,891
prior to her testimony,

1519
01:09:06,959 --> 01:09:09,495
and an affidavit stating
you paid Ms. Webster

1520
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,397
to falsely testify.

1521
01:09:13,434 --> 01:09:16,102
Mr. Hunt, harassment
is a civil violation.

1522
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:17,504
The penalty is money.

1523
01:09:17,572 --> 01:09:19,572
But witness tampering,
that's a crime,

1524
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,074
and you will go to prison,

1525
01:09:21,142 --> 01:09:22,409
where I guarantee
you'll learn

1526
01:09:22,477 --> 01:09:24,244
more about unwanted
sexual advances

1527
01:09:24,312 --> 01:09:26,113
than you can possibly imagine.

1528
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:29,583
Do you think
this is going to intimidate me?

1529
01:09:29,651 --> 01:09:31,718
Even if this evidence
was credible,

1530
01:09:31,786 --> 01:09:33,153
who are you going to get
to prosecute

1531
01:09:33,221 --> 01:09:35,088
a small-time
witness tampering charge, huh?

1532
01:09:35,156 --> 01:09:38,625
Harvey, didn't you graduate
law school

1533
01:09:38,693 --> 01:09:40,795
with the current
U.S. Attorney in New York?

1534
01:09:40,862 --> 01:09:42,529
In fact, I did.

1535
01:09:42,597 --> 01:09:44,097
And I think
he might even be interested

1536
01:09:44,165 --> 01:09:45,465
in pursuing a case like this.

1537
01:09:45,533 --> 01:09:46,934
Wait, are you two still close?

1538
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:48,568
Well, I was the best man
at his wedding.

1539
01:09:48,636 --> 01:09:50,103
- Wow.
- No, you weren't.

1540
01:09:50,171 --> 01:09:51,438
You're bluffing.

1541
01:09:51,506 --> 01:09:52,873
No.

1542
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,341
I think I've got
some pictures...

1543
01:09:54,408 --> 01:09:57,177
of us at the ceremony.

1544
01:09:57,244 --> 01:09:59,145
Let's see.

1545
01:09:59,213 --> 01:10:01,580
Yeah.
Here we are.

1546
01:10:01,648 --> 01:10:04,617
You must admit,
I look very dashing.

1547
01:10:04,684 --> 01:10:05,884
This is me and his mother.

1548
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,352
The woman adores me.

1549
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:08,954
Here we are
at his bachelor party.

1550
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:11,422
There's no strippers.
It was lame.

1551
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:13,925
But he can't put guys like you
away for sexual harassment

1552
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:15,827
and then go to strip clubs,
now, can he?

1553
01:10:15,894 --> 01:10:17,429
All right.
What do you want?

1554
01:10:17,497 --> 01:10:19,964
An admission of guilt
and a guarantee

1555
01:10:20,032 --> 01:10:22,601
that you'll obtain treatment
before working again.

1556
01:10:24,671 --> 01:10:27,106
And Nancy gets reinstated
with back pay.

1557
01:10:27,174 --> 01:10:29,943
- Fine.
- And a raise.

1558
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:32,011
Okay.
All right.

1559
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:33,747
Are we done?

1560
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,449
The kid should be able
to grow up without the burden

1561
01:10:35,517 --> 01:10:37,250
of tuition hanging over
his head, don't you think?

1562
01:10:37,318 --> 01:10:38,418
Which is why
you're also gonna pay Nancy

1563
01:10:38,486 --> 01:10:39,753
an extra $250,000.

1564
01:10:39,821 --> 01:10:41,221
Charles.

1565
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,626
Gentlemen.

1566
01:10:59,472 --> 01:11:02,174
[Laughs]

1567
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:09,583
Thank you for everything.

1568
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:11,185
You're welcome.

1569
01:11:11,253 --> 01:11:12,686
So just one question.

1570
01:11:12,754 --> 01:11:13,854
Why'd you go
to Joanna's house?

1571
01:11:13,922 --> 01:11:15,690
Because I figured it out.

1572
01:11:15,758 --> 01:11:17,158
I object.

1573
01:11:17,226 --> 01:11:18,893
I think you did it
because you care.

1574
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,162
I did it because it's my job.

1575
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:23,231
Would you admit it?
You care about me.

1576
01:11:23,299 --> 01:11:25,600
I saw you smile when I showed up
for work this morning.

1577
01:11:25,668 --> 01:11:29,537
I didn't smile.
I was thinking of a funny joke.

1578
01:11:29,605 --> 01:11:31,372
Look,
we start on this tomorrow.

1579
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,741
Does this mean
we're officially a team now?

1580
01:11:33,809 --> 01:11:35,843
I wouldn't move your things
into Wayne Manor just yet.

1581
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:39,747
- So now you're Batman?
- Closer to him than Clemenza.

1582
01:11:39,815 --> 01:11:42,884
- Oh, yeah, Kilmer.
- Clooney.

1583
01:11:42,952 --> 01:11:44,619
Both: Keaton.

1584
01:11:44,687 --> 01:11:47,656
Did you really quit
when you first started?

1585
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:49,224
Of course not.
I'm not a wuss.
