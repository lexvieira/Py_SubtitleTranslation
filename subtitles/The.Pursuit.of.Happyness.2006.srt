1
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,129
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,233
-All right, Dad.
-Come on.

3
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,802
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,552
-I think I should make a list.
-What do you mean?

5
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,222
-For your birthday gifts?
-Yeah.

6
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,824
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:49,229
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,332
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,667
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,504
-I think so.
-All right. That's good.

11
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,378
-How you doing in here, man?
-Okay.

12
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,555
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,759
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,594
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,397
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,502
Excuse me.

17
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,904
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,474
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,912
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,616
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an I.

21
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,754
I'm Chris Gardner.

22
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,391
I met my father for the first time
when I was 28 years old.

23
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,793
And I made up my mind
as a young kid...

24
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,528
...that when I had children...

25
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,931
...my children were gonna know
who their father was.

26
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,670
This is part of my life story.

27
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,807
This part is called "Riding the Bus."

28
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,915
What's that?

29
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,785
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,054
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,557
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,858
This machine...

33
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,627
...this machine on my lap--

34
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,762
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,965
He travels in the past
with this machine and....

36
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,535
--it is not a time machine.

37
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,671
It's a portable
bone-density scanner.

38
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,041
A medical device I sell for a living.

39
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,811
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,080
-I appreciate it.
-We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,015
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,484
-Well, maybe next--
-Thank you.

43
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:57,623
It gave a slightly denser picture
than an x-ray for twice the money.

44
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,128
-Hey.
-Hey, baby.

45
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,963
-What happened?
-No, nothing.

46
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,832
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,601
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,570
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,873
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,709
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,978
-Yes.
-And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,749
-What are you gonna do about that?
-Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:31,157
You see that car? The one
with the pretty yellow shoe on it?

54
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,825
That's mine.

55
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,961
There's no parking near hospitals.

56
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,730
That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.

57
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,799
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,902
-Maybe next quarter.
-It's possible.

59
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,442
I needed to sell at least two scanners
a month for rent and daycare.

60
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,644
I'd have to sell one more...

61
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,615
...to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.

62
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,457
The problem is...

63
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,794
...I haven't sold any for a while.

64
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,064
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,867
Since birth?

66
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,472
-What's that?
-What?

67
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,708
-What is this?
-It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,478
-From who?
-Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,714
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,883
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,720
Make every side the same color.

72
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,191
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,727
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,699
-You already filed an extension.
-Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,736
That's-- It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,005
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,675
-And a penalty?
-Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:01,547
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,852
-Come here. Calm down.
-I have to go back to work.

80
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,563
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,067
A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for...

82
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,004
...a comprehensive audit, if you will,
of our economic condition.

83
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,541
You won't like it. I didn't like it.

84
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,243
But we have to face the truth...

85
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,112
...and then go to work
to turn things around.

86
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:37,083
And make no mistake about it,
we can turn them around.

87
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,520
The federal budget is out of control.

88
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,990
And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion...

89
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,693
...for this budget year
that ends September 30th.

90
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:53,032
That deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1957.

91
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,868
And so is the almost $80 billion...

92
00:08:56,002 --> 00:09:00,273
...we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.

93
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,609
Twenty years ago, in 1960...

94
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,914
...our federal government payroll
was less than $13 billion.

95
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,816
Today it is 75 billion.

96
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:16,656
During these 20 years, our population
has only increased by 23.3 percent....

97
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,577
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,846
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,284
-I'm a stockbroker.
-Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,687
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,657
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,093
-That's it.
-Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,362
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,098
-But I need it back for Monday.
-Feed the meter.

105
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,741
I still remember that moment.

106
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,717
They all looked
so damn happy to me.

107
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,159
Why couldn't I look like that?

108
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,145
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,415
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,985
-For what?
-I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,855
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,290
You know, when I--

113
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,193
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,764
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,800
What job?

116
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,371
Stockbroker.

117
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,977
-Stockbroker?
-Yeah.

118
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,312
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,898
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,769
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,771
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,474
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,011
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,980
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,049
Probably not.

126
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,819
We're already two months behind.

127
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,988
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:07,493
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,231
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:16,168
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,472
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,173
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,810
What's the matter with you?

134
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,516
Linda.

135
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,785
Linda.

136
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:04,884
This part of my life
is called "Being Stupid."

137
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,154
Can I ask you a favor, miss?

138
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,158
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,994
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,163
...looking smalltime.

141
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,368
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,938
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:31,544
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right? Be right back.

144
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,053
-Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
-Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,488
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

146
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,524
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,961
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,964
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,133
I mean, I'm-- You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,269
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so....

151
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,539
Normally I have a résumé sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:04,143
-We....
-Thank you very much.

153
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,444
I need to go.

154
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,913
I'll bring this back.

155
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,183
-Thank you.
-Okay.

156
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:22,094
Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.
Why did I do that?

157
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,963
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:29,468
Like I said, this part of my life
is called "Being Stupid."

159
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:37,376
Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't move!
Don't move! Stay--!

160
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,653
Stop! Stop!

161
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,156
Don't move!
Stop this--! Stop the train!

162
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,426
Stop! Stop!

163
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,145
The program took just 20 people
every six months.

164
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,414
One got the job.

165
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:22,321
There were three blank lines after
"high school" to list more education.

166
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,592
I didn't need that many lines.

167
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,667
Try and sleep. It's late.

168
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,247
It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches
by 3 inches on each side...

169
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,050
...made up of multiple colors
that you twist and turn...

170
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,686
...and try to get
to a solid color on each side.

171
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,489
This little cube
is the gift sensation of 1981.

172
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,224
Don't expect to solve it easily.

173
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,961
Although we did encounter
one math professor at USF...

174
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,496
...who took just 30 minutes on his.

175
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,066
This is as far as I've gotten
on mine.

176
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,502
As you can see,
I still have a long way to go.

177
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,372
This is Jim Finnerty reporting
for KJSF in Richmond.

178
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,308
Hey, wake up.

179
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,077
Eat.

180
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,547
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, baby.

181
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,616
-Come back without that, please.
-Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,020
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,522
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,725
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

185
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,093
Bye, Mom.

186
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,762
Bye.

187
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,632
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,103
-Is it an adjective?
-No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,038
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,641
-Is "fuck" spelled right?
-Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,212
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:58,250
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,286
-But just don't use that one, okay?
-Okay.

194
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,589
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,025
My nickname.

196
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,659
We pick nicknames.

197
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,330
-Oh, yeah? What's it say?
-"Hot Rod."

198
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,368
-Did you have a nickname?
-Yep.

199
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,304
-What?
-"Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,408
-What's that?
-I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:27,279
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,083
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,685
-Hoss wears that hat.
-Hoss?

204
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,687
Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.

205
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,658
-How do you know Bonanza?
-We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,462
-You watch Bonanza at daycare?
-Yeah.

207
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,565
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,469
-After snack? After your nap?
-After Love Boat.

209
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,543
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,781
-Yeah, what'd you put on there?
-A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:10,689
-He says he's been watching TV.
-Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,126
-Love Boat?
-For history. Navy.

213
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,495
That's not the Navy.

214
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,764
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,435
We're paying you $150 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,105
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:30,109
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:37,182
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,421
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,156
Bye.

221
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,404
I was waiting for
Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...

222
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:38,177
...whose name sounded so delightful,
like he'd give me a job and a hug.

223
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,347
I just had to show him I was good
with numbers and good with people.

224
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,216
-Morning, Mr. Twistle.
-Good morning.

225
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,751
-Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
-Hi.

226
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,687
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

227
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,457
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,860
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

229
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,896
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

230
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,832
-Yes, sir. You have a great day.
-You too.

231
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,541
Hey, yeah, how you doing?

232
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,843
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,379
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

234
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,916
I was wondering if--
Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,719
Right. We can still--? Half an hour?

236
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:24,623
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,369
Hey! Hey!

238
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,738
Hey!

239
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,406
This part of my life...

240
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,343
-Wait!
-...this part here...

241
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,479
...it's called "Running."

242
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,615
Hey! Hey!

243
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,416
Wait!

244
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,020
Hey! Wait!

245
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,656
That was my stolen machine.

246
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,891
Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.

247
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,694
Which was unlikely...

248
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,597
...because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.

249
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,500
I spent our entire life savings
on these things.

250
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,506
It was such
a revolutionary machine.

251
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,009
-Can you feel it, baby?
-Oh, yeah.

252
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,744
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,513
What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals...

254
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,584
...would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.

255
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,657
I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.

256
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:37,796
So if I lost one, it was like losing
a month's groceries.

257
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,669
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,341
Hey, get back here!

259
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,415
Hey, man, I--

260
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,552
-Who's he?
-He's that guy....

261
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,833
-Did you forget?
-Forget what?

262
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,403
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

263
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,740
-Yeah, I know.
-You have two now.

264
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,685
Hey.

265
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,123
Hey, Mom.

266
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:47,499
One, two, three!

267
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,670
-That's a basketball!
-Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,672
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

269
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,709
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

270
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,445
-No, it's not.
-There, there.

271
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,849
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:14,059
-That paper's a little heavy, huh?
-Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,906
You should've seen me
out there today.

274
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,776
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down--

275
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,511
Whatever.

276
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,048
-What?
-Whatever, Chris.

277
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,584
What the hell
you got attitude about?

278
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,587
-"Whatever" what?
-Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,022
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,658
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

281
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,160
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,896
-I'm trying to keep a clean house.
-Hey, wait a second.

283
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,799
Listen. Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,469
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:02,440
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

286
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:07,612
-So you don't trust me now?
-Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,963
-Taxi!
-Mr. Twistle.

288
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,833
-Yeah, hi.
-Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,835
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:33,138
I submitted an application for the
intern program about a month ago...

291
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,707
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly--

292
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,776
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,179
-Take care of yourself.
-Mr. Twistle.

294
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,849
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,784
How about we share a ride?

296
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,521
-All right, get in.
-All right.

297
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,196
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,233
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:06,104
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,973
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:13,278
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and....

302
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,749
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important--

303
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,051
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,222
-I can do it.
-No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,125
-That's bullshit.
-No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,829
-No, you can't.
-Let me see it.

307
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,664
Give it here.

308
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:39,905
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,673
Sorry.

310
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:48,079
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the center pieces never move.

311
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,316
So if it's yellow in the center,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,085
If it's red in the center,
that's the red side.

313
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,956
-Okay.
-So.... You can slow down.

314
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:01,226
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,061
-Yeah, I can.
-No, you can't.

316
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,596
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

317
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,698
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,835
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,984
You almost have this side.

320
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,053
Holy cow.

321
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:42,067
-You almost had that one.
-I'm gonna get it.

322
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,309
Look at that.

323
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,900
You're almost there.

324
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:43,261
-17.10.
-This is me.

325
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,898
Good job.

326
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,836
-Goodbye.
-Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,940
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,110
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,182
Two-- A couple of blocks.

330
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,852
-Just flip around.
-Okay.

331
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,397
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,365
-Where are you going? Come here!
-No!

333
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,335
-No, no, no!
-You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,037
-Give me my money.
-Please stop.

335
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,172
-Please, please, please!
-Son of a bitch.

336
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,975
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,777
-Come here!
-I'm sorry.

338
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,512
-I'm so sorry.
-I'll kick your ass!

339
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,249
-I'm sorry!
-Idiot.

340
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,328
I'll get you!

341
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:27,098
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,482
Hey!

343
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,552
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,054
Stop him!

345
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,027
Stop him!

346
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,967
The doors are closing.

347
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,004
Please stand clear of the doors.

348
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,048
No! No! No!

349
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,452
No!

350
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,078
-Hello?
-Hey, yeah.

351
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,980
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

352
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:53,351
-Chris, I missed my shift.
-Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:56,955
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,390
I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.

355
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,559
-What?
-Did you hear what I said?

356
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:06,397
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

357
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,199
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,001
I'm gonna put the phone down.

359
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:13,605
-Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold--
-I'm going to leave. We are leaving.

360
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,914
It was right then that I started
thinking about Thomas Jefferson...

361
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,517
...the Declaration of Independence...

362
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:32,991
...and the part about our right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

363
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,993
And I remember thinking:

364
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:39,464
How did he know
to put the "pursuit" part in there?

365
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:44,402
That maybe happiness is something
that we can only pursue.

366
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,572
And maybe we can actually
never have it...

367
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,574
...no matter what.

368
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,509
How did he know that?

369
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,550
Linda. Linda.

370
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,252
-Hello?
-Chris.

371
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,121
-Who is this?
-Jay Twistle.

372
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,657
-Hey.
-Dean Witter.

373
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,593
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,330
I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?

375
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,597
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,968
I'll tell you what. Come on by
day after tomorrow, in the morning.

377
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,738
We're interviewing for the internships.
You got a pen and paper?

378
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,573
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,346
-Hold on one second.
-All right.

380
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,352
Hello?

381
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,754
-Chris?
-Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,690
Write this number down so you can
call my secretary, Janice.

383
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,093
-She can give you all the specifics.
-Yep.

384
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,128
-Okay, 415.
-415.

385
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,063
-864.
-864.

386
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,232
-0256.
-0256.

387
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,402
-Yeah, extension 4796.
-4796.

388
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:28,773
-Right. Call her tomorrow.
-Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

389
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,375
-Okay, buddy.
-All right, yes.

390
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,677
-Thank you very much.
-We'll see you soon.

391
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,647
864-0256.

392
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:40,151
4796. Janice.

393
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,056
-Chris.
-Hey.

394
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,392
Did you--? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

395
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,527
-No. You catch the game last night?
-No, no.

396
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,162
You didn't see that, 118, 1--?

397
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,531
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

398
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,402
-No, I haven't seen them.
-119-120. Double overtime.

399
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,670
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 17 seconds left.

400
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,506
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,775
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

402
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,644
-What's your problem with numbers?
-864-2....

403
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,746
-And you owe me money.
-Yeah.

404
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,715
You owe me $14.

405
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,784
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,254
I need my money.
I need my money.

407
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,424
Fourteen's a number.

408
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:49,153
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

409
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,555
-You hear me?
-Leave me alone!

410
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,557
Don't take my son away
from me again.

411
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,559
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

412
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,162
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,730
-Do you wanna leave?
-Yeah.

414
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,767
-You wanna leave?
-Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,837
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

416
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,639
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,242
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

418
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,479
-You are so weak.
-No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,348
-I'm just not happy!
-Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,783
Just go get happy.

421
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,319
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,321
-Stop!
-Did you hear what I said?

423
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,890
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,153
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,588
-How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
-Hi.

426
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,794
-Where's Mom?
-Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,532
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

428
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,700
Yeah, I know.

429
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:15,540
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,247
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,516
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

432
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,419
-Yeah.
-All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,956
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,724
-Yeah.
-All right.

435
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,927
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,831
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

437
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,914
Christopher.

438
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,435
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,936
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,606
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

441
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,809
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

442
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,611
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,314
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

444
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,751
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,253
I got painters coming in.

446
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,655
-All right, look. I need more time.
-No.

447
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,924
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:45,596
All right, but I just-- I gotta have some
more time-- I got my son up in here.

449
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:55,339
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

450
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,759
Chris Gardner?

451
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,996
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,067
-Payable to the City of San Francisco.
-Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,837
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,572
This is all I got.

455
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,714
We verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

456
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,351
-What?
-You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,954
No.

458
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,956
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,792
-I have to pick up my son.
-We verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:26,597
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 10:15 tomorrow morning.

461
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,599
-I cannot stay--
-9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,001
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

463
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,738
-Is there anyone else who can--?
-I take care of him.

464
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,941
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

465
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,749
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,087
-Hello.
-Hey.

467
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,022
What do you want?

468
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:57,862
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

469
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:02,733
Just keep him for the night and I'm--
And-- Just one night.

470
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,935
What happened?

471
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,672
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,641
I'm gonna go right--
You can just--

473
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,043
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

474
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,881
-No.
-Come on, Linda.

475
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:21,452
-Why you doing that?
-No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:25,890
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,193
-How is he?
-He's fine.

478
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,630
All right, just-- All right,
take him to the park...

479
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,634
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,770
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,673
Okay?

482
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,442
Linda?

483
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,544
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,548
All right, all right.

485
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,616
Thank you.

486
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,554
Bye.

487
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,980
I'm okay?

488
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,050
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,052
Yes, I did.

490
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,630
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,605
This way.

492
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,809
It'll be right over there.

493
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,223
What is the one like that one?

494
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,846
Chris Gardner.

495
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,051
Chris Gardner.

496
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,587
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,958
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

498
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,093
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,897
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

500
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,765
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:26,103
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

502
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:30,274
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:35,312
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:40,250
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,187
So the truth is...

506
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,056
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,125
Parking tickets?

508
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:52,162
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,331
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

510
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,735
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,004
Is it dry now?

512
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,972
I hope so.

513
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,841
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,377
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

515
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,846
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

516
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,316
-He said you're smart.
-Well, I like to think so.

517
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,686
-And you want to learn this business?
-Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,888
Have you already started learning
on your own?

519
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,757
Absolutely.

520
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,192
-Jay?
-Yes, sir.

521
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,428
How many times
have you seen Chris?

522
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,331
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

523
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,300
-Was he ever dressed like this?
-No.

524
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,836
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,675
First in your class in school?

526
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,710
-High school?
-Yes, sir.

527
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,080
-How many in the class?
-Twelve.

528
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,015
It was a small town.

529
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:48,852
-I'll say.
-But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:52,222
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

531
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,460
Can I say something?

532
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,363
I'm the type of person...

533
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:02,933
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

534
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,335
...I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

535
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:06,937
But I bet you what.

536
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:12,109
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

537
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,079
Is that fair enough?

538
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,414
Chris.

539
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,486
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,822
...without a shirt on...

541
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,958
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

542
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,232
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

543
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:53,417
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,019
-...but you pulled it off.
-Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,489
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,792
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,862
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

548
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,064
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime--

549
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,333
What are you talking--?
You hounded me for this.

550
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,269
-You stood here--
-Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:13,904
-No.
-I was not aware of that.

552
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,772
My circumstances
have changed some...

553
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,943
-...and I need to be certain that I'll be--
-All right. Okay.

554
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,548
Tonight.

555
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,285
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:31,455
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,791
Yes, an ass-- A-hole.

558
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,362
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,934
You are a piece of work.

560
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,436
Tonight.

561
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,813
There was no salary.

562
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,117
Not even a reasonable promise
of a job.

563
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:11,361
One intern was hired at the end
of the program from a pool of 20.

564
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,063
And if you weren't that guy...

565
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,599
...you couldn't even apply
the six months' training...

566
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,568
...to another brokerage.

567
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,306
The only resource I would have
for six months...

568
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:26,410
...would be my six scanners,
which I could still try to sell.

569
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:31,148
If I sold them all,
maybe we might get by.

570
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:21,265
-I got him. I got him.
-He's asleep.

571
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,033
All right.

572
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,275
Okay, baby.

573
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,522
I got it.

574
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,562
I'm going to New York.

575
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,361
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:28,432
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,635
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,540
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,350
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,618
He should be with his mom.

581
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,654
I should have him, right?

582
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,057
You know
you can't take care of him.

583
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,400
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:11,208
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,743
...and I got it.

586
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,545
So I'm gonna stand out
in my program.

587
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,383
Salesman to intern's backwards.

588
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,518
No, it's not.

589
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,389
I gotta go.

590
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,324
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,527
And....

592
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,735
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:13,670
I know that.

594
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:58,148
-Dean Witter.
-Yes, hi.

595
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:02,185
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,789
-Your name?
-Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,257
The message is:

598
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:13,163
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the program.

599
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:19,236
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,271
Is that all?

601
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,139
Yes, that's it.

602
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,908
-Okay.
-Thank you.

603
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,743
Bye.

604
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:54,671
-Be careful with that.
-What?

605
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,641
Be care-- Go ahead.

606
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,467
-Are we there?
-Yep.

607
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,350
-Hey, you know what today is?
-Yeah.

608
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,252
-What?
-Saturday.

609
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,654
-You know what Saturday is, right?
-Yeah.

610
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,357
-What?
-Basketball.

611
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,427
-You wanna go play some basketball?
-Okay.

612
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,330
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:57,634
-How about that? Wanna do that?
-No.

614
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,338
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,874
I'm going pro.

616
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,577
Okay.

617
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,580
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,550
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

619
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,786
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

620
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,790
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

621
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,660
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

622
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,696
...I really-- You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,432
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

624
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,034
-All right?
-All right.

625
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,036
Okay.

626
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,872
All right, go ahead.

627
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,431
Hey.

628
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,836
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,673
...you can't do something.

630
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,509
Not even me.

631
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,946
-All right?
-All right.

632
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,816
You got a dream...

633
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,385
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,988
People can't do something
themselves...

635
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,691
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

636
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:35,832
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

637
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,508
Let's go.

638
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,014
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:53,750
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

640
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:57,987
-You gotta trust me, all right?
-I trust you.

641
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,957
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

642
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,128
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

643
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,897
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,467
I don't know, Christopher.

645
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,669
Dad, listen to this.

646
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:16,406
One day, a man was drowning
in the water.

647
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,942
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

648
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,578
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

649
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,881
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

650
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,550
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

651
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,819
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

652
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:33,156
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

653
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,926
And God said, "I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

654
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,729
Do you like it?

655
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,665
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

656
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,173
-Thank you very much, sir.
-Yes, sir.

657
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,041
-You got the bill of sale here.
-Yes.

658
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,777
All the information you'll need.

659
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,678
Thank you very much
for your business.

660
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:57,180
Thank you.

661
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,752
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

662
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,621
...7, 8, 9, 10.

663
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,189
Thank you.

664
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,594
-Hey, you want one of those?
-No, it's okay.

665
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,997
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

666
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:18,535
-You like that one? How much?
-Twenty-five cents.

667
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:36,486
This part of my life
is called "Internship."

668
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,923
The 1200 building is
Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.

669
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:42,525
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

670
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,661
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

671
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,663
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

672
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,899
...from every Fortune 500 company
in the financial district.

673
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,902
You will be pooling
from 60 Fortune companies.

674
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,805
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

675
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:59,042
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

676
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:02,612
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

677
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:05,815
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

678
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:10,854
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

679
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,089
...we'll cook the fish.

680
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:15,892
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

681
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:18,628
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

682
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,264
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

683
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,766
That person's gonna be the guy...

684
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,135
...who can turn this into this.

685
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,572
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

686
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,875
You, you, help me hand these out.

687
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,778
This is going to be your bible.

688
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,213
You'll eat with it.

689
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,148
-You'll drink with it.
-It was simple.

690
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:42,285
X number of calls
equals X number of prospects.

691
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,622
X number of prospects
equals X number of customers.

692
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,892
X number of customers
equals X number of dollars...

693
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,194
-...in the company's pocket.
-Your board exam.

694
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:57,267
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

695
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,904
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass/fail.

696
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,607
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

697
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,043
Be safe, score a hundred.

698
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:11,180
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

699
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,326
-Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
-Hi.

700
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,862
-Chris, how are you?
-I'm good. How you doing?

701
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:30,099
-Fine, thank you for asking.
-First day in there. It was exciting.

702
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,335
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

703
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,337
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

704
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:37,640
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

705
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,309
Oh, man, I remember mine.

706
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:42,045
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

707
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,781
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

708
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,251
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

709
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,753
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

710
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,222
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so--

711
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:55,825
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

712
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,828
-No, go ahead.
-Good talking to you, sir.

713
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:32,195
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

714
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,331
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

715
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,867
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

716
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,236
I'm trying to cross the street.

717
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,973
-Well, you're all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

718
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,875
-Where's my shoe?
-What?

719
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:49,879
-You knocked off my shoe!
-I don't know where your shoe is.

720
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,150
-Where's my damn shoe?
-I don't know.

721
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,391
Hey.

722
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,728
-Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
-No, I'm sorry.

723
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:09,165
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

724
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:12,268
-We should wait for the police.
-I gotta go to work.

725
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,806
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

726
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,710
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

727
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,922
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

728
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:37,126
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

729
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,333
Dad.

730
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,937
-You don't have a shoe.
-Yeah, I know.

731
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:51,174
-Wanna know what happened?
-Yeah.

732
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:53,342
I got hit by a car.

733
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,245
-You got hit by a car?
-Yep.

734
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:00,116
-Where?
-Just right by the office.

735
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:03,352
-No, where in your body?
-Like, the back of my legs.

736
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,354
-Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
-Goodbye.

737
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:08,858
-Were you on the street?
-Yeah, I was running in the street.

738
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,961
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

739
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,097
Yeah, thanks.

740
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,065
I'll remember that next time.

741
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:19,836
And here I was again.

742
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,472
-Show up early.
-While qualified persons...

743
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:26,776
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

744
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,845
-Now, Chris.
-Yes, sir.

745
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:31,047
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

746
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,051
Favors for Frakesh,
our office manager. All day.

747
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,920
My name is Chris Gardner
calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.

748
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,456
Yes, sir, we're having a lunch
actually this Thursday.

749
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,526
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

750
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,128
Okay, yes, thank you.

751
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,829
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

752
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:50,767
-Chris?
-Yes, sir.

753
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:55,204
Feeling underrated
and unappreciated.

754
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,073
Hello, Mr. Ronald Fryer.

755
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,475
Good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner.

756
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,077
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

757
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,514
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax--

758
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:07,016
Okay, thank you, sir.

759
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:12,889
Then catch the bus by 4 to the place
where they can't spell "happiness."

760
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:14,857
Then the cross-town.

761
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,160
The 22 home.

762
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:21,063
-Hey, Chris!
-Hey. Hi, Ralph.

763
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:24,167
-I'm waiting.
-All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

764
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,369
I'm gonna get that for you.

765
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,980
Whoever brought in the most money
after six months was usually hired.

766
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:40,316
Hello, Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Walter Hobb.

767
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:43,519
We were all working our way
up call sheets to sign clients.

768
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,122
-From the bottom to the top.
-Yes, sir.

769
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:49,058
-From the doorman to the CEO.
-Okay.

770
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,361
They'd stay till 7,
but I had Christopher.

771
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,531
I had to do in six hours
what they do in nine.

772
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:59,101
Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

773
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,870
In order not to waste any time...

774
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,239
...I wasn't hanging up the phone
in between calls.

775
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,408
Okay, thank you very much.

776
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,212
I realized that
by not hanging up the phone...

777
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,314
...I gained another eight minutes
a day.

778
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,916
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

779
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,586
-I'm calling from Dean Witter.
-I wasn't drinking water...

780
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:18,988
...so I didn't waste any time
in the bathroom.

781
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,224
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity--

782
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,427
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

783
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,062
But even doing all this...

784
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:30,299
...after two months, I still didn't have
time to work my way up a sheet.

785
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:46,115
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

786
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,416
Walter Ribbon's office.

787
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,020
Yes, hello, my name is Chris Gardner.
I'm calling for Mr. Walter Ribbon.

788
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:52,255
-Concerning?
-Yes, ma'am.

789
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,656
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

790
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,591
Just a moment.

791
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,295
-Hello?
-Mr. Ribbon.

792
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:02,465
Hello, sir. My name's Chris Gardner.
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

793
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,400
-Yeah, Chris.
-Yes, Mr. Ribbon...

794
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:08,070
...I would love to have the opportunity
to discuss some of our products.

795
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,606
I'm certain that I could
be of some assistance to you.

796
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,608
Can you be here in 20 minutes?

797
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:17,013
-Twenty minutes. Absolutely.
-Just had someone cancel.

798
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,248
I can give you a few minutes
before the 49ers.

799
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:22,518
-Monday Night Football, buddy.
-Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

800
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,121
-See you soon.
-Bye-bye.

801
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,625
Excuse me. Thank you.

802
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,494
-Chris, what's up?
-Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

803
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,129
Hey, do you have five minutes?

804
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,997
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon--

805
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:38,267
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

806
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,637
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

807
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:45,174
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

808
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,977
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

809
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,545
And you have to jimmy that.

810
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,714
-Jimmy what?
-You have to jimmy the key.

811
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:56,585
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

812
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,537
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

813
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,275
Oh, no!

814
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,078
Come on.

815
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:37,159
-Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
-Thank you.

816
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:44,734
-Thanks a lot.
-Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

817
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:52,141
No, no, no!

818
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,054
Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone
for me, please.

819
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:54,570
-Hi.
-Hi.

820
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:57,440
I'm Chris Gardner. I have
an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

821
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,108
Oh, you just missed him.

822
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,212
Thank you.

823
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:31,207
-What's that?
-Just filling out a check...

824
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,776
...paying some bills...

825
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,178
...and a parking ticket.

826
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,116
We don't have a car anymore.

827
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,485
Yep, I know.

828
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:49,125
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

829
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:51,494
A couple of doctors' offices.

830
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:55,764
-On sales calls, okay?
-Okay.

831
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:02,671
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

832
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:05,708
-Really?
-Possibly.

833
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,611
-All right?
-All right.

834
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,846
Come on, finish up.

835
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:14,416
-Are you sure?
-Possibly.

836
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,253
Really?

837
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:51,654
-Are you bringing it to the game?
-Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

838
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:54,790
And maybe
we're going to the game.

839
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:00,362
-Where are we going now?
-To see someone about my job.

840
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,431
I don't understand.

841
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:05,734
-You don't understand what?
-Are we going to the game?

842
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,537
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

843
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:10,906
-You know what "possibly" means?
-Like probably.

844
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,842
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

845
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:16,812
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

846
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:20,216
-What does "probably" mean?
-It means we have a good chance.

847
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,684
And what does "possibly" mean?

848
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:24,420
-I know what it means.
-What does it mean?

849
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,223
It means that we're not going
to the game.

850
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,994
-How did you get so smart?
-Because you're smart.

851
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,868
-Are we there?
-Yeah.

852
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:46,909
-Mr. Ribbon.
-Yes?

853
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,012
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

854
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,982
-Oh, hi. Hi.
-This is my son, Christopher.

855
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:54,750
-Hi.
-Hey, Christopher.

856
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:57,386
-What are you doing up here?
-I came to apologize...

857
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:00,389
-...for missing our appointment.
-You didn't need to come up.

858
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:03,292
We were in the neighborhood
visiting a very close friend...

859
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:06,762
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

860
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:09,798
-I know you probably waited for me.
-Little bit.

861
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,601
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

862
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,803
Oh, come on. What's that?

863
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:18,540
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

864
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,378
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

865
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:25,314
-I have a meeting after the game.
-You're going to the game?

866
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,016
-Yeah.
-Possibly.

867
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:29,418
-Possibly.
-We're going too.

868
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,387
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 12-year-old.

869
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,688
We were just leaving. Tim!

870
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,857
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

871
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,860
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

872
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:40,029
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

873
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:41,797
-You got it.
-Thank you very much.

874
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,699
You take care. Here, come on.

875
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,334
-Say bye-bye, Chris.
-Bye.

876
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,002
Bye, Christopher.

877
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,804
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

878
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,907
-What--? To Candlestick?
-We're going now. Come with us.

879
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,411
-Where are your seats?
-We've-- We're upper deck.

880
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:56,745
We got a box. Come on.

881
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:59,048
-You wanna sit in the box?
-No.

882
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:04,353
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

883
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,889
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

884
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:11,427
-Okay.
-Okay, kids in the back.

885
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,096
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

886
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,802
-Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
-We don't have a car.

887
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,871
-Oh, my--
-What happened?

888
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,540
I think I got stung by a bee.

889
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,643
-You all right?
-Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

890
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,479
-You're not allergic or anything?
-No, no, no.

891
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:33,916
-Where'd he get you?
-Just right at the back of my head.

892
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,618
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

893
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,887
-Does it hurt?
-Christopher, I'm fine.

894
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,925
-Let me see.
-Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

895
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:45,594
Thomas Jefferson mentions
happiness a couple times...

896
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:48,597
...in the Declaration
of Independence.

897
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,600
May seem like a strange word
to be in that document...

898
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:56,739
...but he was sort of....
He was an artist.

899
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:01,577
He called the English
"the disturbers of our harmony."

900
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,612
And I remember standing there
that day...

901
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,014
...thinking about
the disturbers of mine.

902
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:10,619
Questions I had:
Whether all this was good.

903
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,721
Whether I'd make it.

904
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,727
And Walter Ribbon
and his Pacific Bell pension money...

905
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:20,162
...which was millions.

906
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,030
Yeah!

907
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,534
It was a way to another place.

908
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:28,404
Wow, this is....

909
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,606
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

910
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,876
-Thank you very much for this, really.
-Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

911
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:37,479
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

912
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,616
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

913
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,951
...which we believe
to be far superior...

914
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,721
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

915
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,823
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

916
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:53,028
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

917
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:55,931
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

918
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:59,501
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

919
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,837
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

920
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:05,073
So, you know, come on, relax.
Enjoy the game. Go, go, go!

921
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:07,476
Yes!

922
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,548
Yes! Yeah!

923
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,086
-Here you go.
-All right.

924
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,088
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

925
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,991
-Chris, I'll talk to you later.
-I'm gonna give you a call.

926
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,993
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

927
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,695
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

928
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:36,138
-Bye.
-Bye, Christopher.

929
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:10,172
After four months, we had sold
all our scanners.

930
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:12,908
It seemed we were making it.

931
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,043
What's the...

932
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,946
-...fastest animal in the world?
-Jackrabbit.

933
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:23,652
It seemed we were doing good.

934
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,621
Until one day...

935
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:27,589
...that day...

936
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,992
...that letter brought me
back to earth.

937
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,968
This part of my life is called
"Paying Taxes."

938
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,171
If you didn't pay them...

939
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:46,575
...the government could stick
their hands into your bank account...

940
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,277
...and take your money.

941
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:49,645
Dad.

942
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:51,780
No warning. Nothing.

943
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:55,050
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

944
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:58,320
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

945
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,022
I was-- I was--

946
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:03,659
Listen, I--
That's all the money that I have.

947
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:08,063
You cannot go into my bank acc--
No--

948
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,699
It was the 25th of September.

949
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,634
I remember that day.

950
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,870
Because that's the day
that I found out...

951
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:20,142
...there was only 21 dollars
and 33 cents left in my bank account.

952
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,077
I was broke.

953
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,823
-Dressed yet?
-No.

954
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:41,930
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

955
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:44,967
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

956
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,770
-I need that money now, not later.
-When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

957
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,839
Now!

958
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,678
Hey, what's happening, man?

959
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:59,715
Wayne, I need to get
that $14 from you.

960
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:03,151
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

961
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:06,388
-What? Why?
-Why what?

962
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:09,024
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

963
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:11,159
I helped you move.

964
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:16,264
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

965
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,266
That's 200 yards.

966
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,369
It's been four months, Wayne.

967
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:24,206
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

968
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:26,842
-I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
-Go get my money.

969
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,177
-Wayne, get my mo--
-I really don't, man. It's $14.

970
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,113
It's my $14!
Go get my money!

971
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:33,915
-All of this for $14.
-Get my money, Wayne.

972
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,336
Dad, look at me!

973
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,672
Dad.

974
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:01,109
-Should I go?
-Sure, man. Why not?

975
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,193
-Stay here.
-Dad, look.

976
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:20,062
-No, no. Stay right here.
-Dad.

977
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:23,031
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

978
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:31,707
-Dad, where you going?
-Hey, what did I say?

979
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,244
Dad!

980
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,948
Dad, wait! Dad!

981
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:50,092
-Dad.
-I gotta--

982
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:53,762
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

983
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:58,166
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

984
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:03,972
Bring back my time machine!

985
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,975
Bring my time machine back!

986
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:19,387
-Dad, where are we going?
-Be quiet.

987
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,858
Go get your things. Go.

988
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,549
-Chris?
-Yes.

989
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:51,853
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

990
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,367
Where are we going now?

991
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:09,404
We gotta-- We gotta
see somebody else.

992
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:13,575
I'm tired.

993
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,312
I know.

994
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:28,890
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

995
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,459
-I have to go now, Chris.
-No, no, no.

996
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:35,530
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

997
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,601
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

998
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,838
-No, no. I have to fix it now.
-No.

999
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:48,210
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

1000
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,478
I really have to go, Chris.

1001
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,381
Thank you. Thank you.

1002
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,450
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1003
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:57,352
I'll see you soon.

1004
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:51,907
Why are our things here?

1005
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:54,409
Dad.

1006
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:39,621
-Let's go. Come on.
-Where?

1007
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,591
-Just out of here.
-Why?

1008
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:46,728
-We can't stay here tonight.
-Yes, we can. Open the door!

1009
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:50,065
-Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
-Open the door!

1010
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:55,537
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

1011
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:57,305
Stop it.

1012
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,078
Come on.

1013
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:13,521
Come on.

1014
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,240
Wayne!

1015
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:35,243
Wayne!

1016
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,652
Wayne!

1017
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:04,039
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1018
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:21,756
Where are we going?

1019
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:27,362
-Dad, where are we going?
-I don't know.

1020
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,280
It's not a time machine.

1021
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:46,781
Dad.

1022
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,550
It's not a time machine.

1023
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:52,120
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1024
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,756
-What guy?
-The guy. He was at the park.

1025
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,858
He said it was a time machine.

1026
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:04,499
Yes, it is.

1027
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:07,802
No, it's not.

1028
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,773
-It is.
-No, it's not.

1029
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:22,584
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1030
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:26,855
Wanna push it?

1031
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,194
Okay.

1032
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,297
Come on.

1033
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,400
Come on, man.

1034
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:46,207
Right here.

1035
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:48,209
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1036
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:50,512
I don't know.
Some place from before.

1037
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:52,313
You gotta close your eyes.

1038
01:25:52,514 --> 01:25:54,449
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1039
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:58,920
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1040
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,628
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1041
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:09,531
It takes a few seconds.

1042
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,801
Oh, my goodness.

1043
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:16,304
Open, open, open!

1044
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:22,343
-What is it?
-Dinosaurs.

1045
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:24,679
-Where?
-You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1046
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:29,684
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1047
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,821
-Do you see them?
-Yeah.

1048
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:35,490
Wait. Come on, come on.

1049
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:36,925
-Wait, watch out.
-What is it?

1050
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:39,327
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

1051
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,763
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

1052
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:43,498
...and it's cold out here, okay?

1053
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:46,568
-Watch out!
-Whoa! Oh, my good-- A T. rex.

1054
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:50,438
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

1055
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:54,475
-We gotta find someplace safe.
-Like what?

1056
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:56,611
We need a cave.

1057
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:57,845
A cave?

1058
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:00,248
-We gotta find a cave. Come on.
-Okay.

1059
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,217
Come on, come on.

1060
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:04,986
Watch your back! Look out.

1061
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,388
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1062
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:10,458
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1063
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,826
Go ahead. Get in.

1064
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,861
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1065
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:21,369
-Are we safe?
-Yeah, I think so.

1066
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:30,872
Hey.

1067
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,075
-How you doing, Jay?
-I'm doing good.

1068
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,777
How are you getting along?

1069
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,079
-Good. I'm good.
-You doing good?

1070
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:40,882
-How you doing?
-I'm doing great.

1071
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:43,685
Where you going?

1072
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:49,957
I-- Sacramento.

1073
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:53,394
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from--

1074
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:56,064
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over--

1075
01:28:56,397 --> 01:28:57,598
Get them over to us.

1076
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:59,567
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1077
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:01,602
Awesome.

1078
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,738
Hey, let them win a round.

1079
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:10,878
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

1080
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:14,115
-Where?
-He's outside. Please come with me.

1081
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:25,126
-Hi.
-How you doing?

1082
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:29,564
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

1083
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:33,468
We need a room.

1084
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:36,871
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1085
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:39,807
-There's just some glass work.
-Let me stop you right there.

1086
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:42,610
-I wish I could help you--
-This is my son, Christopher.

1087
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:44,779
-He's 5 years old.
-Hi, baby.

1088
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:48,015
-We need some place to stay.
-Okay, and I would love to help you...

1089
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:51,052
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

1090
01:29:51,385 --> 01:29:54,489
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

1091
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:55,957
We gotta stay together.

1092
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,525
We got-- We're--

1093
01:29:57,658 --> 01:29:59,627
-Okay, listen.
-You gotta have some place--

1094
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:02,697
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1095
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,465
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1096
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:07,935
-And where is it? Come on.
-Ellis and Jones.

1097
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:48,843
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

1098
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:52,079
-Man.
-Hey, come on, man.

1099
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:53,614
-Come on.
-Come on, what?

1100
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:55,449
-Hey, that's my spot.
-Back off.

1101
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:57,952
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't--

1102
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:01,923
Dad!

1103
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:04,525
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1104
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:06,160
Stop! Stop!

1105
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:08,763
Get out of line, both of you.
Both of you.

1106
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:11,599
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

1107
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,801
I got here on time. I was in line.

1108
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,770
I came from work, I got my son.

1109
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:18,573
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1110
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:20,208
He sliced in front of him in line.

1111
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,810
-Who did?
-He did.

1112
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:27,648
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1113
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,860
That's it. No more.

1114
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,836
-What's your favorite color?
-Green.

1115
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:50,204
Green?

1116
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:53,574
-What do you like that's green?
-Trees.

1117
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:56,744
Trees. What else?

1118
01:31:56,878 --> 01:31:58,279
Holly.

1119
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:04,051
-Holly. What's holly?
-The Christmas stuff.

1120
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:06,854
Christmas stuff.

1121
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:09,290
What's that?

1122
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:15,596
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1123
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:27,041
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

1124
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:29,176
Can he breathe?

1125
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,779
-He's good?
-Yeah.

1126
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,115
-I gotta go work on the scanner--
-Don't go.

1127
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:37,652
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

1128
01:32:37,785 --> 01:32:41,923
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1129
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:45,059
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1130
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:47,795
I wanna go home.

1131
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:53,701
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

1132
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:56,270
All right?

1133
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:58,572
I'm gonna go out there.

1134
01:32:58,706 --> 01:33:02,043
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1135
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:04,912
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1136
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:07,949
-All right?
-All right.

1137
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:10,584
You gotta trust me, okay?

1138
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:12,787
You gotta trust me.

1139
01:33:13,654 --> 01:33:16,223
I trust you. I trust you.

1140
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:17,925
I trust you.

1141
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:21,095
-I can't hear you.
-I trust you. I trust you.

1142
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:26,701
Give me a kiss.

1143
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:42,216
-I'll just be a little while, okay?
-All right.

1144
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,152
-I'll be right here.
-Okay.

1145
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,688
-Can you still hear me?
-Yeah.

1146
01:33:47,822 --> 01:33:49,256
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

1147
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,993
-Do you trust me?
-Yeah.

1148
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:40,908
-Yeah.
-Like that?

1149
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:44,812
-Yeah, put that....
-Then you go like that.

1150
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:48,382
-Is that okay?
-I don't know. What do you think?

1151
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:49,784
Good.

1152
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:53,254
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1153
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:57,425
-Dad, why don't you leave it?
-We can't.

1154
01:34:57,758 --> 01:34:59,894
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1155
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:01,695
Go.

1156
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:08,269
Hey, Chris.

1157
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:11,906
-Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
-What's up?

1158
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:13,941
Work trip.

1159
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:16,310
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

1160
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,312
-Yes, she does.
-And you guys are both...

1161
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:20,281
...looking to retire at the same time?

1162
01:35:20,414 --> 01:35:22,817
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

1163
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,385
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1164
01:35:24,718 --> 01:35:28,022
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1165
01:35:28,422 --> 01:35:30,424
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal...?

1166
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:32,460
I learned to finish my work quickly.

1167
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:35,096
I had to finish quickly.

1168
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:38,966
To get in line at Glide by 5.

1169
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:44,505
Come on.

1170
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:46,740
Come on.

1171
01:35:50,778 --> 01:35:53,447
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

1172
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:56,183
My Captain America!

1173
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:58,786
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1174
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:02,156
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

1175
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:06,460
-Why don't you let the lady in?
-Hey, back up.

1176
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:09,864
-Hey, man, that's not cool.
-Back up! Back up!

1177
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:19,507
Come on.

1178
01:36:22,476 --> 01:36:24,879
Dad, we need to get it!

1179
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:30,084
The important thing about
that freedom train...

1180
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:32,386
...is it's got to climb mountains.

1181
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,356
We all have to deal with mountains.

1182
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:38,459
You know, mountains
that go way up high.

1183
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:41,028
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1184
01:36:41,162 --> 01:36:42,396
-Amen, preacher!
-Yes.

1185
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:44,999
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

1186
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,334
We sing about them.

1187
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:53,574
Lord, don't move that mountain

1188
01:36:55,075 --> 01:37:01,448
Give me strength to climb it

1189
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:08,589
Please don't move
That stumbling block

1190
01:37:08,923 --> 01:37:15,429
But lead me, Lord, around it

1191
01:37:17,097 --> 01:37:22,169
My burdens, they get so heavy

1192
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:29,543
Seems hard to bear

1193
01:37:30,477 --> 01:37:34,148
But I won't give up
No, no

1194
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:36,350
Because you promised me

1195
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:43,290
You'd meet me at the altar of prayer

1196
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:51,098
-Lord don't move that mountain
-Please don't move that mountain

1197
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:56,470
But give me strength to climb it

1198
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:00,641
When's your test?

1199
01:38:01,976 --> 01:38:03,410
Tomorrow.

1200
01:38:07,881 --> 01:38:09,550
Are you ready?

1201
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:15,022
Of course.

1202
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:55,362
Thank you, sir.

1203
01:39:04,638 --> 01:39:07,041
-Hey. How you doing?
-Hey.

1204
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:14,048
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere...?

1205
01:39:14,181 --> 01:39:16,583
I have to go somewhere.

1206
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:20,087
-But I finished the whole thing too.
-Oh, good.

1207
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:22,189
-You?
-Yeah.

1208
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:25,592
-How'd you feel about the graphs?
-Easy.

1209
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:30,631
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

1210
01:39:30,964 --> 01:39:34,501
-Essay question?
-Yeah, on the back.

1211
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:45,746
Hey, Chris.

1212
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,316
-Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
-Yeah.

1213
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:53,087
-Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
-I never actually got your number.

1214
01:39:54,021 --> 01:39:56,623
Listen. Here's my number.
Call me, okay?

1215
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:59,526
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1216
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:04,164
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

1217
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:06,533
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

1218
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:09,703
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

1219
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:17,344
-I'll pay you back, honest.
-Five is good?

1220
01:40:17,478 --> 01:40:21,215
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

1221
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:37,097
That's it. That's the room quota.

1222
01:40:37,364 --> 01:40:40,200
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1223
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:43,270
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

1224
01:40:43,404 --> 01:40:46,440
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

1225
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:51,044
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

1226
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:27,648
You like it?

1227
01:42:18,665 --> 01:42:22,436
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

1228
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:29,209
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1229
01:42:29,343 --> 01:42:32,212
-How much?
-Eight dollars.

1230
01:42:33,247 --> 01:42:36,550
-What's that?
-It's to repair the light.

1231
01:42:36,683 --> 01:42:38,752
Can I see it?

1232
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:43,724
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

1233
01:42:43,857 --> 01:42:48,495
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

1234
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:51,532
I don't mind.

1235
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,800
Yeah, you will.

1236
01:43:10,183 --> 01:43:12,519
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

1237
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:13,820
Okay.

1238
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:17,257
-Warm enough?
-Yeah.

1239
01:43:17,424 --> 01:43:19,192
All right.

1240
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:24,197
Did Mom leave because of me?

1241
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:31,638
-What?
-Did Mom leave because of me?

1242
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:40,714
Don't-- Don't even think
something like that.

1243
01:43:41,748 --> 01:43:43,884
Mom left because of Mom.

1244
01:43:44,217 --> 01:43:46,486
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1245
01:43:46,987 --> 01:43:48,956
Okay.

1246
01:43:58,799 --> 01:44:00,867
You're a good papa.

1247
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:10,744
All right, go to sleep.

1248
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:14,548
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1249
01:45:10,904 --> 01:45:12,939
So far, so good, Chris.

1250
01:45:18,945 --> 01:45:21,648
-It works.
-Thank you very much.

1251
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:25,686
Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Four more weeks of oxygen.

1252
01:45:25,919 --> 01:45:30,323
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1253
01:45:30,457 --> 01:45:33,093
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1254
01:45:34,394 --> 01:45:35,929
-Anything else?
-Nope, that's it.

1255
01:45:36,063 --> 01:45:37,564
Thank you. Thank you.

1256
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:39,666
-You ready?
-Yep.

1257
01:45:41,568 --> 01:45:44,538
-Are we going to the church place?
-No.

1258
01:45:44,671 --> 01:45:46,673
Where are we going, then?

1259
01:45:47,474 --> 01:45:49,976
-Probably stay at a hotel.
-A hotel?

1260
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:51,378
Just for the night.

1261
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:54,347
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1262
01:45:54,481 --> 01:45:56,116
No, thank you.

1263
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:58,885
-Ever?
-I hope not.

1264
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:00,587
Why not?

1265
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:03,623
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

1266
01:46:03,757 --> 01:46:06,059
...and then not so much the next.

1267
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:09,362
-Like the bus?
-Yeah, like the bus.

1268
01:46:09,496 --> 01:46:12,766
I'm sorry. Guess I shouldn't laugh,
should I?

1269
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:16,470
It's promised in the Bible.
Pa says we'll find it some day.

1270
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:18,805
He doesn't know where it is, though.

1271
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:23,110
Didn't you ever want to have a home
of your own like other people?

1272
01:46:23,443 --> 01:46:25,011
Sure.

1273
01:46:25,612 --> 01:46:27,614
Sometimes when we're moving
at night...

1274
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:30,851
...we pass houses with lights
and people.

1275
01:46:30,984 --> 01:46:33,754
Sometimes you can
hear them laughing....

1276
01:46:38,391 --> 01:46:41,728
The next day, after work...

1277
01:46:41,862 --> 01:46:44,064
...we just went to the beach.

1278
01:46:44,397 --> 01:46:46,166
Far away from anything.

1279
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,801
Everything.

1280
01:46:47,934 --> 01:46:49,703
Just Christopher and me.

1281
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:53,707
-Did you see me?
-Yeah.

1282
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:56,943
Far away from buses and noise...

1283
01:46:57,077 --> 01:47:02,816
...and a constant disappointment
in my ten-gallon head...

1284
01:47:03,917 --> 01:47:05,852
...and in myself.

1285
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,822
-Chris, thank you very much.
-Well, thank you, Dean.

1286
01:47:08,955 --> 01:47:10,891
-Take care.
-You made all the right moves.

1287
01:47:11,024 --> 01:47:12,659
Thanks, Chris.

1288
01:47:14,661 --> 01:47:15,962
Because when I was young...

1289
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:19,933
...and I'd get an A on a history test
or whatever...

1290
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:24,805
...I'd get this good feeling about
all the things that I could be.

1291
01:47:26,673 --> 01:47:30,210
And then I never became
any of them.

1292
01:47:37,818 --> 01:47:40,453
-Hey, Chris.
-Hey.

1293
01:47:40,587 --> 01:47:43,123
-How you doing, Jay?
-I'm doing fine.

1294
01:47:43,456 --> 01:47:47,594
Rumor has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

1295
01:47:47,727 --> 01:47:49,095
Yeah, yeah.

1296
01:47:49,229 --> 01:47:53,099
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

1297
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:54,968
I guess.

1298
01:47:57,938 --> 01:48:00,140
So one more day.

1299
01:48:00,473 --> 01:48:01,975
Getting nervous?

1300
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:04,945
-No, I'm okay.
-Yeah?

1301
01:48:05,078 --> 01:48:07,047
Listen, whatever happens...

1302
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,749
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

1303
01:48:09,883 --> 01:48:11,585
I mean that.

1304
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:14,120
Take care of yourself.

1305
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:32,272
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1306
01:48:32,606 --> 01:48:34,774
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

1307
01:48:34,908 --> 01:48:37,544
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

1308
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:39,713
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

1309
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:41,915
Yes, sir.

1310
01:48:42,048 --> 01:48:43,583
No, sir, that's it.

1311
01:48:43,717 --> 01:48:46,152
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1312
01:48:47,787 --> 01:48:50,724
Chris. Come.

1313
01:49:18,018 --> 01:49:21,121
-Hi, Chris.
-Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

1314
01:49:22,188 --> 01:49:24,190
-Nice shirt.
-Thank you, sir.

1315
01:49:24,324 --> 01:49:25,692
-Chris.
-Hey, Jay.

1316
01:49:26,026 --> 01:49:30,263
-Chris.
-Chris, sit down, please.

1317
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:37,270
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1318
01:49:37,604 --> 01:49:39,606
You know,
being the last day and all.

1319
01:49:39,739 --> 01:49:43,043
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1320
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:45,779
But...

1321
01:49:45,912 --> 01:49:48,782
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1322
01:49:48,915 --> 01:49:51,885
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

1323
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:55,855
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

1324
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:58,992
Would you like that, Chris?

1325
01:49:59,893 --> 01:50:01,594
Yes, sir.

1326
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:05,065
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1327
01:50:06,032 --> 01:50:09,169
So welcome.

1328
01:50:11,037 --> 01:50:16,076
-Was it as easy as it looked?
-No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

1329
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:20,847
-Good luck, Chris.
-Thank you. Thank you.

1330
01:50:25,051 --> 01:50:26,753
Thank you, sir.

1331
01:50:27,153 --> 01:50:29,089
Oh, Chris.

1332
01:50:31,658 --> 01:50:33,760
I almost forgot.

1333
01:50:35,762 --> 01:50:37,263
Thank you.

1334
01:50:57,751 --> 01:50:59,919
This part of my life...

1335
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:03,023
...this little part...

1336
01:51:06,259 --> 01:51:08,995
...is called "Happiness."

1337
01:51:55,742 --> 01:51:59,279
Christopher. Christopher.
Come here.

1338
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:31,344
So how many...

1339
01:52:31,478 --> 01:52:33,446
...planets are there?

1340
01:52:34,848 --> 01:52:36,516
-Seven.
-Seven?

1341
01:52:37,117 --> 01:52:38,985
Nine.

1342
01:52:41,254 --> 01:52:43,356
Who's the king of the jungle?

1343
01:52:43,857 --> 01:52:46,459
-Gorilla.
-The gorilla?

1344
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:48,228
The gorilla?

1345
01:52:48,361 --> 01:52:50,130
No. Lion.

1346
01:52:50,263 --> 01:52:52,966
Oh, yeah. Lion, lion, lion.

1347
01:52:55,001 --> 01:52:58,004
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

1348
01:52:58,138 --> 01:53:00,140
-Who's there?
-Shelby.

1349
01:53:00,273 --> 01:53:01,374
Shelby who?

1350
01:53:01,508 --> 01:53:05,378
Shelby coming around the mountain
When she comes

1351
01:53:06,212 --> 01:53:07,547
-Knock knock.
-Who's there?

1352
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:10,283
-Nobody.
-Nobody who?

1353
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:13,019
Nobody who?

1354
01:53:16,222 --> 01:53:19,225
Now, that's funny. I like that one.
